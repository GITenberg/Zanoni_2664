      DEDICATORY EPISTLE First prefixed to the Edition of 1845
    </h4>
    <p>
      TO JOHN GIBSON, R.A., SCULPTOR.
    </p>
    <p>
      In looking round the wide and luminous circle of our great living
      Englishmen, to select one to whom I might fitly dedicate this work,&mdash;one
      who, in his life as in his genius, might illustrate the principle I have
      sought to convey; elevated by the ideal which he exalts, and serenely
      dwelling in a glorious existence with the images born of his imagination,&mdash;in
      looking round for some such man, my thoughts rested upon you. Afar from
      our turbulent cabals; from the ignoble jealousy and the sordid strife
      which degrade and acerbate the ambition of Genius,&mdash;in your Roman
      Home, you have lived amidst all that is loveliest and least perishable in
      the past, and contributed with the noblest aims, and in the purest spirit,
      to the mighty heirlooms of the future. Your youth has been devoted to
      toil, that your manhood may be consecrated to fame: a fame unsullied by
      one desire of gold. You have escaped the two worst perils that beset the
      artist in our time and land,&mdash;the debasing tendencies of commerce,
      and the angry rivalries of competition. You have not wrought your marble
      for the market,&mdash;you have not been tempted, by the praises which our
      vicious criticism has showered upon exaggeration and distortion, to lower
      your taste to the level of the hour; you have lived, and you have
      laboured, as if you had no rivals but in the dead,&mdash;no purchasers,
      save in judges of what is best. In the divine priesthood of the beautiful,
      you have sought only to increase her worshippers and enrich her temples.
      The pupil of Canova, you have inherited his excellences, while you have
      shunned his errors,&mdash;yours his delicacy, not his affectation. Your
      heart resembles him even more than your genius: you have the same noble
      enthusiasm for your sublime profession; the same lofty freedom from envy,
      and the spirit that depreciates; the same generous desire not to war with
      but to serve artists in your art; aiding, strengthening, advising,
      elevating the timidity of inexperience, and the vague aspirations of
      youth. By the intuition of a kindred mind, you have equalled the learning
      of Winckelman, and the plastic poetry of Goethe, in the intimate
      comprehension of the antique. Each work of yours, rightly studied, is in
      itself a CRITICISM, illustrating the sublime secrets of the Grecian Art,
      which, without the servility of plagiarism, you have contributed to revive
      amongst us; in you we behold its three great and long-undetected
      principles,&mdash;simplicity, calm, and concentration.
    </p>
    <p>
      But your admiration of the Greeks has not led you to the bigotry of the
      mere antiquarian, nor made you less sensible of the unappreciated
      excellence of the mighty modern, worthy to be your countryman,&mdash;though
      till his statue is in the streets of our capital, we show ourselves not
      worthy of the glory he has shed upon our land. You have not suffered even
      your gratitude to Canova to blind you to the superiority of Flaxman. When
      we become sensible of our title-deeds to renown in that single name, we
      may look for an English public capable of real patronage to English Art,&mdash;and
      not till then.
    </p>
    <p>
      I, artist in words, dedicate, then, to you, artist whose ideas speak in
      marble, this well-loved work of my matured manhood. I love it not the less
      because it has been little understood and superficially judged by the
      common herd: it was not meant for them. I love it not the more because it
      has found enthusiastic favorers amongst the Few. My affection for my work
      is rooted in the solemn and pure delight which it gave me to conceive and
      to perform. If I had graven it on the rocks of a desert, this apparition
      of my own innermost mind, in its least-clouded moments, would have been to
      me as dear; and this ought, I believe, to be the sentiment with which he
      whose Art is born of faith in the truth and beauty of the principles he
      seeks to illustrate, should regard his work. Your serener existence,
      uniform and holy, my lot denies,&mdash;if my heart covets. But our true
      nature is in our thoughts, not our deeds: and therefore, in books&mdash;which
      ARE his thoughts&mdash;the author&rsquo;s character lies bare to the discerning
      eye. It is not in the life of cities,&mdash;in the turmoil and the crowd;
      it is in the still, the lonely, and more sacred life, which for some
      hours, under every sun, the student lives (his stolen retreat from the
      Agora to the Cave), that I feel there is between us the bond of that
      secret sympathy, that magnetic chain, which unites the everlasting
      brotherhood of whose being Zanoni is the type.

    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One of the peculiarities of Bulwer was his passion for occult studies.
      They had a charm for him early in life, and he pursued them with the
      earnestness which characterised his pursuit of other studies. He became
      absorbed in wizard lore; he equipped himself with magical implements,&mdash;with
      rods for transmitting influence, and crystal balls in which to discern
      coming scenes and persons; and communed with spiritualists and mediums.
      The fruit of these mystic studies is seen in &ldquo;Zanoni&rdquo; and &ldquo;A strange
      Story,&rdquo; romances which were a labour of love to the author, and into which
      he threw all the power he possessed,&mdash;power re-enforced by
      multifarious reading and an instinctive appreciation of Oriental thought.
      These weird stories, in which the author has formulated his theory of
      magic, are of a wholly different type from his previous fictions, and, in
      place of the heroes and villains of every day life, we have beings that
      belong in part to another sphere, and that deal with mysterious and occult
      agencies. Once more the old forgotten lore of the Cabala is unfolded; the
      furnace of the alchemist, whose fires have been extinct for centuries, is
      lighted anew, and the lamp of the Rosicrucian re-illumined. No other works
      of the author, contradictory as have been the opinions of them, have
      provoked such a diversity of criticism as these. To some persons they
      represent a temporary aberration of genius rather than any serious thought
      or definite purpose; while others regard them as surpassing in bold and
      original speculation, profound analysis of character, and thrilling
      interest, all of the author&rsquo;s other works. The truth, we believe, lies
      midway between these extremes. It is questionable whether the introduction
      into a novel of such subjects as are discussed in these romances be not an
      offence against good sense and good taste; but it is as unreasonable to
      deny the vigour and originality of their author&rsquo;s conceptions, as to deny
      that the execution is imperfect, and, at times, bungling and absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been justly said that the present half century has witnessed the
      rise and triumphs of science, the extent and marvels of which even Bacon&rsquo;s
      fancy never conceived, simultaneously with superstitions grosser than any
      which Bacon&rsquo;s age believed. &ldquo;The one is, in fact, the natural reaction
      from the other. The more science seeks to exclude the miraculous, and
      reduce all nature, animate and inanimate, to an invariable law of
      sequences, the more does the natural instinct of man rebel, and seek an
      outlet for those obstinate questionings, those &lsquo;blank misgivings of a
      creature moving about in worlds not realised,&rsquo; taking refuge in delusions
      as degrading as any of the so-called Dark Ages.&rdquo; It was the revolt from
      the chilling materialism of the age which inspired the mystic creations of
      &ldquo;Zanoni&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Strange Story.&rdquo; Of these works, which support and
      supplement each other, one is the contemplation of our actual life through
      a spiritual medium, the other is designed to show that, without some
      gleams of the supernatural, man is not man, nor nature nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      In &ldquo;Zanoni&rdquo; the author introduces us to two human beings who have achieved
      immortality: one, Mejnour, void of all passion or feeling, calm,
      benignant, bloodless, an intellect rather than a man; the other, Zanoni,
      the pupil of Mejnour, the representative of an ideal life in its utmost
      perfection, possessing eternal youth, absolute power, and absolute
      knowledge, and withal the fullest capacity to enjoy and to love, and, as a
      necessity of that love, to sorrow and despair. By his love for Viola
      Zanoni is compelled to descend from his exalted state, to lose his eternal
      calm, and to share in the cares and anxieties of humanity; and this
      degradation is completed by the birth of a child. Finally, he gives up the
      life which hangs on that of another, in order to save that other, the
      loving and beloved wife, who has delivered him from his solitude and
      isolation. Wife and child are mortal, and to outlive them and his love for
      them is impossible. But Mejnour, who is the impersonation of thought,&mdash;pure
      intellect without affection,&mdash;lives on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bulwer has himself justly characterised this work, in the Introduction, as
      a romance and not a romance, as a truth for those who can comprehend it,
      and an extravagance for those who cannot. The most careless or
      matter-of-fact reader must see that the work, like the enigmatical
      &ldquo;Faust,&rdquo; deals in types and symbols; that the writer intends to suggest to
      the mind something more subtle and impalpable than that which is embodied
      to the senses. What that something is, hardly two persons will agree. The
      most obvious interpretation of the types is, that in Zanoni the author
      depicts to us humanity, perfected, sublimed, which lives not for self, but
      for others; in Mejnour, as we have before said, cold, passionless,
      self-sufficing intellect; in Glyndon, the young Englishman, the mingled
      strength and weakness of human nature; in the heartless, selfish artist,
      Nicot, icy, soulless atheism, believing nothing, hoping nothing, trusting
      and loving nothing; and in the beautiful, artless Viola, an exquisite
      creation, pure womanhood, loving, trusting and truthful. As a work of art
      the romance is one of great power. It is original in its conception, and
      pervaded by one central idea; but it would have been improved, we think,
      by a more sparing use of the supernatural. The inevitable effect of so
      much hackneyed diablerie&mdash;of such an accumulation of wonder upon
      wonder&mdash;is to deaden the impression they would naturally make upon
      us. In Hawthorne&rsquo;s tales we see with what ease a great imaginative artist
      can produce a deeper thrill by a far slighter use of the weird and the
      mysterious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief interest of the story for the ordinary reader centres, not in
      its ghostly characters and improbable machinery, the scenes in Mejnour&rsquo;s
      chamber in the ruined castle among the Apennines, the colossal and
      appalling apparitions on Vesuvius, the hideous phantom with its burning
      eye that haunted Glyndon, but in the loves of Viola and the mysterious
      Zanoni, the blissful and the fearful scenes through which they pass, and
      their final destiny, when the hero of the story sacrifices his own
      &ldquo;charmed life&rdquo; to save hers, and the Immortal finds the only true
      immortality in death. Among the striking passages in the work are the
      pathetic sketch of the old violinist and composer, Pisani, with his
      sympathetic &ldquo;barbiton&rdquo; which moaned, groaned, growled, and laughed
      responsive to the feelings of its master; the description of Viola&rsquo;s and
      her father&rsquo;s triumph, when &ldquo;The Siren,&rdquo; his masterpiece, is performed at
      the San Carlo in Naples; Glyndon&rsquo;s adventure at the Carnival in Naples;
      the death of his sister; the vivid pictures of the Reign of Terror in
      Paris, closing with the downfall of Robespierre and his satellites; and
      perhaps, above all, the thrilling scene where Zanoni leaves Viola asleep
      in prison when his guards call him to execution, and she, unconscious of
      the terrible sacrifice, but awaking and missing him, has a vision of the
      procession to the guillotine, with Zanoni there, radiant in youth and
      beauty, followed by the sudden vanishing of the headsman,&mdash;the
      horror,&mdash;and the &ldquo;Welcome&rdquo; of her loved one to Heaven in a myriad of
      melodies from the choral hosts above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zanoni&rdquo; was originally published by Saunders and Otley, London, in three
      volumes 12mo., in 1842. A translation into French, made by M. Sheldon
      under the direction of P. Lorain, was published in Paris in the
      &ldquo;Bibliotheque des Meilleurs Romans Etrangers.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1853.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As a work of imagination, &ldquo;Zanoni&rdquo; ranks, perhaps, amongst the highest of
      my prose fictions. In the Poem of &ldquo;King Arthur,&rdquo; published many years
      afterwards, I have taken up an analogous design, in the contemplation of
      our positive life through a spiritual medium; and I have enforced, through
      a far wider development, and, I believe, with more complete and enduring
      success, that harmony between the external events which are all that the
      superficial behold on the surface of human affairs, and the subtle and
      intellectual agencies which in reality influence the conduct of
      individuals, and shape out the destinies of the world. As man has two
      lives,&mdash;that of action and that of thought,&mdash;so I conceive that
      work to be the truest representation of humanity which faithfully
      delineates both, and opens some elevating glimpse into the sublimest
      mysteries of our being, by establishing the inevitable union that exists
      between the plain things of the day, in which our earthly bodies perform
      their allotted part, and the latent, often uncultivated, often invisible,
      affinities of the soul with all the powers that eternally breathe and move
      throughout the Universe of Spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      I refer those who do me the honour to read &ldquo;Zanoni&rdquo; with more attention
      than is given to ordinary romance, to the Poem of &ldquo;King Arthur,&rdquo; for
      suggestive conjecture into most of the regions of speculative research,
      affecting the higher and more important condition of our ultimate being,
      which have engaged the students of immaterial philosophy in my own age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Affixed to the &ldquo;Note&rdquo; with which this work concludes, and which treats of
      the distinctions between type and allegory, the reader will find, from the
      pen of one of our most eminent living writers, an ingenious attempt to
      explain the interior or typical meanings of the work now before him.

    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is possible that among my readers there may be a few not unacquainted
      with an old-book shop, existing some years since in the neighbourhood of
      Covent Garden; I say a few, for certainly there was little enough to
      attract the many in those precious volumes which the labour of a life had
      accumulated on the dusty shelves of my old friend D&mdash;. There were to
      be found no popular treatises, no entertaining romances, no histories, no
      travels, no &ldquo;Library for the People,&rdquo; no &ldquo;Amusement for the Million.&rdquo; But
      there, perhaps, throughout all Europe, the curious might discover the most
      notable collection, ever amassed by an enthusiast, of the works of
      alchemist, cabalist, and astrologer. The owner had lavished a fortune in
      the purchase of unsalable treasures. But old D&mdash; did not desire to
      sell. It absolutely went to his heart when a customer entered his shop: he
      watched the movements of the presumptuous intruder with a vindictive
      glare; he fluttered around him with uneasy vigilance,&mdash;he frowned, he
      groaned, when profane hands dislodged his idols from their niches. If it
      were one of the favourite sultanas of his wizard harem that attracted you,
      and the price named were not sufficiently enormous, he would not
      unfrequently double the sum. Demur, and in brisk delight he snatched the
      venerable charmer from your hands; accede, and he became the picture of
      despair,&mdash;nor unfrequently, at the dead of night, would he knock at
      your door, and entreat you to sell him back, at your own terms, what you
      had so egregiously bought at his. A believer himself in his Averroes and
      Paracelsus, he was as loth as the philosophers he studied to communicate
      to the profane the learning he had collected.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so chanced that some years ago, in my younger days, whether of
      authorship or life, I felt a desire to make myself acquainted with the
      true origin and tenets of the singular sect known by the name of
      Rosicrucians. Dissatisfied with the scanty and superficial accounts to be
      found in the works usually referred to on the subject, it struck me as
      possible that Mr. D&mdash;&rsquo;s collection, which was rich, not only in
      black-letter, but in manuscripts, might contain some more accurate and
      authentic records of that famous brotherhood,&mdash;written, who knows? by
      one of their own order, and confirming by authority and detail the
      pretensions to wisdom and to virtue which Bringaret had arrogated to the
      successors of the Chaldean and Gymnosophist. Accordingly I repaired to
      what, doubtless, I ought to be ashamed to confess, was once one of my
      favourite haunts. But are there no errors and no fallacies, in the
      chronicles of our own day, as absurd as those of the alchemists of old?
      Our very newspapers may seem to our posterity as full of delusions as the
      books of the alchemists do to us; not but what the press is the air we
      breathe,&mdash;and uncommonly foggy the air is too!
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering the shop, I was struck by the venerable appearance of a
      customer whom I had never seen there before. I was struck yet more by the
      respect with which he was treated by the disdainful collector. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo;
       cried the last, emphatically, as I was turning over the leaves of the
      catalogue,&mdash;&ldquo;sir, you are the only man I have met, in five-and-forty
      years that I have spent in these researches, who is worthy to be my
      customer. How&mdash;where, in this frivolous age, could you have acquired
      a knowledge so profound? And this august fraternity, whose doctrines,
      hinted at by the earliest philosophers, are still a mystery to the latest;
      tell me if there really exists upon the earth any book, any manuscript, in
      which their discoveries, their tenets, are to be learned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the words, &ldquo;august fraternity,&rdquo; I need scarcely say that my attention
      had been at once aroused, and I listened eagerly for the stranger&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, &ldquo;that the masters of the school
      have ever consigned, except by obscure hint and mystical parable, their
      real doctrines to the world. And I do not blame them for their
      discretion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he paused, and seemed about to retire, when I said, somewhat
      abruptly, to the collector, &ldquo;I see nothing, Mr. D&mdash;, in this
      catalogue which relates to the Rosicrucians!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Rosicrucians!&rdquo; repeated the old gentleman, and in his turn he
      surveyed me with deliberate surprise. &ldquo;Who but a Rosicrucian could explain
      the Rosicrucian mysteries! And can you imagine that any members of that
      sect, the most jealous of all secret societies, would themselves lift the
      veil that hides the Isis of their wisdom from the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;this, then, is &lsquo;the august fraternity&rsquo; of which you
      spoke. Heaven be praised! I certainly have stumbled on one of the
      brotherhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I said aloud, &ldquo;if not in books, sir, where else am I to obtain
      information? Nowadays one can hazard nothing in print without authority,
      and one may scarcely quote Shakespeare without citing chapter and verse.
      This is the age of facts,&mdash;the age of facts, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, with a pleasant smile, &ldquo;if we meet again,
      perhaps, at least, I may direct your researches to the proper source of
      intelligence.&rdquo; And with that he buttoned his greatcoat, whistled to his
      dog, and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened that I did meet again with the old gentleman, exactly four
      days after our brief conversation in Mr. D&mdash;&rsquo;s bookshop. I was
      riding leisurely towards Highgate, when, at the foot of its classic hill,
      I recognised the stranger; he was mounted on a black pony, and before him
      trotted his dog, which was black also.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you meet the man whom you wish to know, on horseback, at the
      commencement of a long hill, where, unless he has borrowed a friend&rsquo;s
      favourite hack, he cannot, in decent humanity to the brute creation, ride
      away from you, I apprehend that it is your own fault if you have not gone
      far in your object before you have gained the top. In short, so well did I
      succeed, that on reaching Highgate the old gentleman invited me to rest at
      his house, which was a little apart from the village; and an excellent
      house it was,&mdash;small, but commodious, with a large garden, and
      commanding from the windows such a prospect as Lucretius would recommend
      to philosophers: the spires and domes of London, on a clear day,
      distinctly visible; here the Retreat of the Hermit, and there the Mare
      Magnum of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walls of the principal rooms were embellished with pictures of
      extraordinary merit, and in that high school of art which is so little
      understood out of Italy. I was surprised to learn that they were all from
      the hand of the owner. My evident admiration pleased my new friend, and
      led to talk upon his part, which showed him no less elevated in his
      theories of art than an adept in the practice. Without fatiguing the
      reader with irrelevant criticism, it is necessary, perhaps, as elucidating
      much of the design and character of the work which these prefatory pages
      introduce, that I should briefly observe, that he insisted as much upon
      the connection of the arts, as a distinguished author has upon that of the
      sciences; that he held that in all works of imagination, whether expressed
      by words or by colours, the artist of the higher schools must make the
      broadest distinction between the real and the true,&mdash;in other words,
      between the imitation of actual life, and the exaltation of Nature into
      the Ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is the Dutch School, the other is the Greek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the Dutch is the most in fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in painting, perhaps,&rdquo; answered my host, &ldquo;but in literature&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was of literature I spoke. Our growing poets are all for simplicity
      and Betty Foy; and our critics hold it the highest praise of a work of
      imagination, to say that its characters are exact to common life, even in
      sculpture&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In sculpture! No, no! THERE the high ideal must at least be essential!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me; I fear you have not seen Souter Johnny and Tam O&rsquo;Shanter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the old gentleman, shaking his head, &ldquo;I live very much out of
      the world, I see. I suppose Shakespeare has ceased to be admired?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary; people make the adoration of Shakespeare the excuse for
      attacking everybody else. But then our critics have discovered that
      Shakespeare is so REAL!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Real! The poet who has never once drawn a character to be met with in
      actual life,&mdash;who has never once descended to a passion that is
      false, or a personage who is real!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was about to reply very severely to this paradox, when I perceived that
      my companion was growing a little out of temper. And he who wishes to
      catch a Rosicrucian, must take care not to disturb the waters. I thought
      it better, therefore, to turn the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Revenons a nos moutons,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you promised to enlighten my ignorance
      as to the Rosicrucians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; quoth he, rather sternly; &ldquo;but for what purpose? Perhaps you
      desire only to enter the temple in order to ridicule the rites?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you take me for! Surely, were I so inclined, the fate of the Abbe
      de Villars is a sufficient warning to all men not to treat idly of the
      realms of the Salamander and the Sylph. Everybody knows how mysteriously
      that ingenious personage was deprived of his life, in revenge for the
      witty mockeries of his &lsquo;Comte de Gabalis.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salamander and Sylph! I see that you fall into the vulgar error, and
      translate literally the allegorical language of the mystics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that the old gentleman condescended to enter into a very interesting,
      and, as it seemed to me, a very erudite relation, of the tenets of the
      Rosicrucians, some of whom, he asserted, still existed, and still
      prosecuted, in august secrecy, their profound researches into natural
      science and occult philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this fraternity,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;however respectable and virtuous,&mdash;virtuous
      I say, for no monastic order is more severe in the practice of moral
      precepts, or more ardent in Christian faith,&mdash;this fraternity is but
      a branch of others yet more transcendent in the powers they have obtained,
      and yet more illustrious in their origin. Are you acquainted with the
      Platonists?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have occasionally lost my way in their labyrinth,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Faith, they
      are rather difficult gentlemen to understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet their knottiest problems have never yet been published. Their
      sublimest works are in manuscript, and constitute the initiatory learning,
      not only of the Rosicrucians, but of the nobler brotherhoods I have
      referred to. More solemn and sublime still is the knowledge to be gleaned
      from the elder Pythagoreans, and the immortal masterpieces of Apollonius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apollonius, the imposter of Tyanea! are his writings extant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imposter!&rdquo; cried my host; &ldquo;Apollonius an imposter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon; I did not know he was a friend of yours; and if you
      vouch for his character, I will believe him to have been a very
      respectable man, who only spoke the truth when he boasted of his power to
      be in two places at the same time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so difficult?&rdquo; said the old gentleman; &ldquo;if so, you have never
      dreamed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here ended our conversation; but from that time an acquaintance was formed
      between us which lasted till my venerable friend departed this life. Peace
      to his ashes! He was a person of singular habits and eccentric opinions;
      but the chief part of his time was occupied in acts of quiet and
      unostentatious goodness. He was an enthusiast in the duties of the
      Samaritan; and as his virtues were softened by the gentlest charity, so
      his hopes were based upon the devoutest belief. He never conversed upon
      his own origin and history, nor have I ever been able to penetrate the
      darkness in which they were concealed. He seemed to have seen much of the
      world, and to have been an eye-witness of the first French Revolution, a
      subject upon which he was equally eloquent and instructive. At the same
      time he did not regard the crimes of that stormy period with the
      philosophical leniency with which enlightened writers (their heads safe
      upon their shoulders) are, in the present day, inclined to treat the
      massacres of the past: he spoke not as a student who had read and
      reasoned, but as a man who had seen and suffered. The old gentleman seemed
      alone in the world; nor did I know that he had one relation, till his
      executor, a distant cousin, residing abroad, informed me of the very
      handsome legacy which my poor friend had bequeathed me. This consisted,
      first, of a sum about which I think it best to be guarded, foreseeing the
      possibility of a new tax upon real and funded property; and, secondly, of
      certain precious manuscripts, to which the following volumes owe their
      existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I imagine I trace this latter bequest to a visit I paid the Sage, if so I
      may be permitted to call him, a few weeks before his death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although he read little of our modern literature, my friend, with the
      affable good-nature which belonged to him, graciously permitted me to
      consult him upon various literary undertakings meditated by the desultory
      ambition of a young and inexperienced student. And at that time I sought
      his advice upon a work of imagination, intended to depict the effects of
      enthusiasm upon different modifications of character. He listened to my
      conception, which was sufficiently trite and prosaic, with his usual
      patience; and then, thoughtfully turning to his bookshelves, took down an
      old volume, and read to me, first, in Greek, and secondly, in English,
      some extracts to the following effect:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plato here expresses four kinds of mania, by which I desire to understand
      enthusiasm and the inspiration of the gods: Firstly, the musical;
      secondly, the telestic or mystic; thirdly, the prophetic; and fourthly,
      that which belongs to love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The author he quoted, after contending that there is something in the soul
      above intellect, and stating that there are in our nature distinct
      energies,&mdash;by the one of which we discover and seize, as it were, on
      sciences and theorems with almost intuitive rapidity, by another, through
      which high art is accomplished, like the statues of Phidias,&mdash;proceeded
      to state that &ldquo;enthusiasm, in the true acceptation of the word, is, when
      that part of the soul which is above intellect is excited to the gods, and
      thence derives its inspiration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The author, then pursuing his comment upon Plato, observes, that &ldquo;one of
      these manias may suffice (especially that which belongs to love) to lead
      back the soul to its first divinity and happiness; but that there is an
      intimate union with them all; and that the ordinary progress through which
      the soul ascends is, primarily, through the musical; next, through the
      telestic or mystic; thirdly, through the prophetic; and lastly, through
      the enthusiasm of love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While with a bewildered understanding and a reluctant attention I listened
      to these intricate sublimities, my adviser closed the volume, and said
      with complacency, &ldquo;There is the motto for your book,&mdash;the thesis for
      your theme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Davus sum, non Oedipus,&rdquo; said I, shaking my head, discontentedly. &ldquo;All
      this may be exceedingly fine, but, Heaven forgive me,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      understand a word of it. The mysteries of your Rosicrucians, and your
      fraternities, are mere child&rsquo;s play to the jargon of the Platonists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet, not till you rightly understand this passage, can you understand the
      higher theories of the Rosicrucians, or of the still nobler fraternities
      you speak of with so much levity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if that be the case, I give up in despair. Why not, since you are so
      well versed in the matter, take the motto for a book of your own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I have already composed a book with that thesis for its theme,
      will you prepare it for the public?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the greatest pleasure,&rdquo; said I,&mdash;alas, too rashly!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall hold you to your promise,&rdquo; returned the old gentleman, &ldquo;and when
      I am no more, you will receive the manuscripts. From what you say of the
      prevailing taste in literature, I cannot flatter you with the hope that
      you will gain much by the undertaking. And I tell you beforehand that you
      will find it not a little laborious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your work a romance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a romance, and it is not a romance. It is a truth for those who can
      comprehend it, and an extravagance for those who cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last there arrived the manuscripts, with a brief note from my deceased
      friend, reminding me of my imprudent promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      With mournful interest, and yet with eager impatience, I opened the packet
      and trimmed my lamp. Conceive my dismay when I found the whole written in
      an unintelligible cipher. I present the reader with a specimen:
    </p>
    <p>
      (Several strange characters.)
    </p>
    <p>
      and so on for nine hundred and forty mortal pages in foolscap. I could
      scarcely believe my eyes: in fact, I began to think the lamp burned
      singularly blue; and sundry misgivings as to the unhallowed nature of the
      characters I had so unwittingly opened upon, coupled with the strange
      hints and mystical language of the old gentleman, crept through my
      disordered imagination. Certainly, to say no worse of it, the whole thing
      looked UNCANNY! I was about, precipitately, to hurry the papers into my
      desk, with a pious determination to have nothing more to do with them,
      when my eye fell upon a book, neatly bound in blue morocco, and which, in
      my eagerness, I had hitherto overlooked. I opened this volume with great
      precaution, not knowing what might jump out, and&mdash;guess my delight&mdash;found
      that it contained a key or dictionary to the hieroglyphics. Not to weary
      the reader with an account of my labours, I am contented with saying that
      at last I imagined myself capable of construing the characters, and set to
      work in good earnest. Still it was no easy task, and two years elapsed
      before I had made much progress. I then, by way of experiment on the
      public, obtained the insertion of a few desultory chapters, in a
      periodical with which, for a few months, I had the honour to be connected.
      They appeared to excite more curiosity than I had presumed to anticipate;
      and I renewed, with better heart, my laborious undertaking. But now a new
      misfortune befell me: I found, as I proceeded, that the author had made
      two copies of his work, one much more elaborate and detailed than the
      other; I had stumbled upon the earlier copy, and had my whole task to
      remodel, and the chapters I had written to retranslate. I may say then,
      that, exclusive of intervals devoted to more pressing occupations, my
      unlucky promise cost me the toil of several years before I could bring it
      to adequate fulfilment. The task was the more difficult, since the style
      in the original is written in a kind of rhythmical prose, as if the author
      desired that in some degree his work should be regarded as one of poetical
      conception and design. To this it was not possible to do justice, and in
      the attempt I have doubtless very often need of the reader&rsquo;s indulgent
      consideration. My natural respect for the old gentleman&rsquo;s vagaries, with a
      muse of equivocal character, must be my only excuse whenever the language,
      without luxuriating into verse, borrows flowers scarcely natural to prose.
      Truth compels me also to confess, that, with all my pains, I am by no
      means sure that I have invariably given the true meaning of the cipher;
      nay, that here and there either a gap in the narrative, or the sudden
      assumption of a new cipher, to which no key was afforded, has obliged me
      to resort to interpolations of my own, no doubt easily discernible, but
      which, I flatter myself, are not inharmonious to the general design. This
      confession leads me to the sentence with which I shall conclude: If,
      reader, in this book there be anything that pleases you, it is certainly
      mine; but whenever you come to something you dislike,&mdash;lay the blame
      upon the old gentleman!

    <p>
      At Naples, in the latter half of the last century, a worthy artist named
      Gaetano Pisani lived and flourished. He was a musician of great genius,
      but not of popular reputation; there was in all his compositions something
      capricious and fantastic which did not please the taste of the Dilettanti
      of Naples. He was fond of unfamiliar subjects into which he introduced
      airs and symphonies that excited a kind of terror in those who listened.
      The names of his pieces will probably suggest their nature. I find, for
      instance, among his MSS., these titles: &ldquo;The Feast of the Harpies,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
      Witches at Benevento,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Descent of Orpheus into Hades,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Evil
      Eye,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Eumenides,&rdquo; and many others that evince a powerful imagination
      delighting in the fearful and supernatural, but often relieved by an airy
      and delicate fancy with passages of exquisite grace and beauty. It is true
      that in the selection of his subjects from ancient fable, Gaetano Pisani
      was much more faithful than his contemporaries to the remote origin and
      the early genius of Italian Opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      That descendant, however effeminate, of the ancient union between Song and
      Drama, when, after long obscurity and dethronement, it regained a punier
      sceptre, though a gaudier purple, by the banks of the Etrurian Arno, or
      amidst the lagunes of Venice, had chosen all its primary inspirations from
      the unfamiliar and classic sources of heathen legend; and Pisani&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;Descent of Orpheus&rdquo; was but a bolder, darker, and more scientific
      repetition of the &ldquo;Euridice&rdquo; which Jacopi Peri set to music at the august
      nuptials of Henry of Navarre and Mary of Medicis.* Still, as I have said,
      the style of the Neapolitan musician was not on the whole pleasing to ears
      grown nice and euphuistic in the more dulcet melodies of the day; and
      faults and extravagances easily discernible, and often to appearance
      wilful, served the critics for an excuse for their distaste. Fortunately,
      or the poor musician might have starved, he was not only a composer, but
      also an excellent practical performer, especially on the violin, and by
      that instrument he earned a decent subsistence as one of the orchestra at
      the Great Theatre of San Carlo. Here formal and appointed tasks
      necessarily kept his eccentric fancies in tolerable check, though it is
      recorded that no less than five times he had been deposed from his desk
      for having shocked the conoscenti, and thrown the whole band into
      confusion, by impromptu variations of so frantic and startling a nature
      that one might well have imagined that the harpies or witches who inspired
      his compositions had clawed hold of his instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impossibility, however, to find any one of equal excellence as a
      performer (that is to say, in his more lucid and orderly moments) had
      forced his reinstalment, and he had now, for the most part, reconciled
      himself to the narrow sphere of his appointed adagios or allegros. The
      audience, too, aware of his propensity, were quick to perceive the least
      deviation from the text; and if he wandered for a moment, which might also
      be detected by the eye as well as the ear, in some strange contortion of
      visage, and some ominous flourish of his bow, a gentle and admonitory
      murmur recalled the musician from his Elysium or his Tartarus to the sober
      regions of his desk. Then he would start as if from a dream, cast a
      hurried, frightened, apologetic glance around, and, with a crestfallen,
      humbled air, draw his rebellious instrument back to the beaten track of
      the glib monotony. But at home he would make himself amends for this
      reluctant drudgery. And there, grasping the unhappy violin with ferocious
      fingers, he would pour forth, often till the morning rose, strange, wild
      measures that would startle the early fisherman on the shore below with a
      superstitious awe, and make him cross himself as if mermaid or sprite had
      wailed no earthly music in his ear.

     (*Orpheus was the favourite hero of early Italian Opera, or
     Lyrical Drama. The Orfeo of Angelo Politiano was produced in
     1475. The Orfeo of Monteverde was performed at Venice in
     1667.)
</pre>
    <p>
      This man&rsquo;s appearance was in keeping with the characteristics of his art.
      The features were noble and striking, but worn and haggard, with black,
      careless locks tangled into a maze of curls, and a fixed, speculative,
      dreamy stare in his large and hollow eyes. All his movements were
      peculiar, sudden, and abrupt, as the impulse seized him; and in gliding
      through the streets, or along the beach, he was heard laughing and talking
      to himself. Withal, he was a harmless, guileless, gentle creature, and
      would share his mite with any idle lazzaroni, whom he often paused to
      contemplate as they lay lazily basking in the sun. Yet was he thoroughly
      unsocial. He formed no friends, flattered no patrons, resorted to none of
      the merry-makings so dear to the children of music and the South. He and
      his art seemed alone suited to each other,&mdash;both quaint, primitive,
      unworldly, irregular. You could not separate the man from his music; it
      was himself. Without it he was nothing, a mere machine! WITH it, he was
      king over worlds of his own. Poor man, he had little enough in this! At a
      manufacturing town in England there is a gravestone on which the epitaph
      records &ldquo;one Claudius Phillips, whose absolute contempt for riches, and
      inimitable performance on the violin, made him the admiration of all that
      knew him!&rdquo; Logical conjunction of opposite eulogies! In proportion, O
      Genius, to thy contempt for riches will be thy performance on thy violin!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaetano Pisani&rsquo;s talents as a composer had been chiefly exhibited in music
      appropriate to this his favourite instrument, of all unquestionably the
      most various and royal in its resources and power over the passions. As
      Shakespeare among poets is the Cremona among instruments. Nevertheless, he
      had composed other pieces of larger ambition and wider accomplishment, and
      chief of these, his precious, his unpurchased, his unpublished, his
      unpublishable and imperishable opera of the &ldquo;Siren.&rdquo; This great work had
      been the dream of his boyhood, the mistress of his manhood; in advancing
      age &ldquo;it stood beside him like his youth.&rdquo; Vainly had he struggled to place
      it before the world. Even bland, unjealous Paisiello, Maestro di Capella,
      shook his gentle head when the musician favoured him with a specimen of
      one of his most thrilling scenas. And yet, Paisiello, though that music
      differs from all Durante taught thee to emulate, there may&mdash;but
      patience, Gaetano Pisani! bide thy time, and keep thy violin in tune!
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange as it may appear to the fairer reader, this grotesque personage
      had yet formed those ties which ordinary mortals are apt to consider their
      especial monopoly,&mdash;he was married, and had one child. What is more
      strange yet, his wife was a daughter of quiet, sober, unfantastic England:
      she was much younger than himself; she was fair and gentle, with a sweet
      English face; she had married him from choice, and (will you believe it?)
      she yet loved him. How she came to marry him, or how this shy, unsocial,
      wayward creature ever ventured to propose, I can only explain by asking
      you to look round and explain first to ME how half the husbands and half
      the wives you meet ever found a mate! Yet, on reflection, this union was
      not so extraordinary after all. The girl was a natural child of parents
      too noble ever to own and claim her. She was brought into Italy to learn
      the art by which she was to live, for she had taste and voice; she was a
      dependant and harshly treated, and poor Pisani was her master, and his
      voice the only one she had heard from her cradle that seemed without one
      tone that could scorn or chide. And so&mdash;well, is the rest natural?
      Natural or not, they married. This young wife loved her husband; and young
      and gentle as she was, she might almost be said to be the protector of the
      two. From how many disgraces with the despots of San Carlo and the
      Conservatorio had her unknown officious mediation saved him! In how many
      ailments&mdash;for his frame was weak&mdash;had she nursed and tended him!
      Often, in the dark nights, she would wait at the theatre with her lantern
      to light him and her steady arm to lean on; otherwise, in his abstract
      reveries, who knows but the musician would have walked after his &ldquo;Siren&rdquo;
       into the sea! And then she would so patiently, perhaps (for in true love
      there is not always the finest taste) so DELIGHTEDLY, listen to those
      storms of eccentric and fitful melody, and steal him&mdash;whispering
      praises all the way&mdash;from the unwholesome night-watch to rest and
      sleep!
    </p>
    <p>
      I said his music was a part of the man, and this gentle creature seemed a
      part of the music; it was, in fact, when she sat beside him that whatever
      was tender or fairy-like in his motley fantasia crept into the harmony as
      by stealth. Doubtless her presence acted on the music, and shaped and
      softened it; but, he, who never examined how or what his inspiration, knew
      it not. All that he knew was, that he loved and blessed her. He fancied he
      told her so twenty times a day; but he never did, for he was not of many
      words, even to his wife. His language was his music,&mdash;as hers, her
      cares! He was more communicative to his barbiton, as the learned Mersennus
      teaches us to call all the varieties of the great viol family. Certainly
      barbiton sounds better than fiddle; and barbiton let it be. He would talk
      to THAT by the hour together,&mdash;praise it, scold it, coax it, nay (for
      such is man, even the most guileless), he had been known to swear at it;
      but for that excess he was always penitentially remorseful. And the
      barbiton had a tongue of his own, could take his own part, and when HE
      also scolded, had much the best of it. He was a noble fellow, this Violin!&mdash;a
      Tyrolese, the handiwork of the illustrious Steiner. There was something
      mysterious in his great age. How many hands, now dust, had awakened his
      strings ere he became the Robin Goodfellow and Familiar of Gaetano Pisani!
      His very case was venerable,&mdash;beautifully painted, it was said, by
      Caracci. An English collector had offered more for the case than Pisani
      had ever made by the violin. But Pisani, who cared not if he had inhabited
      a cabin himself, was proud of a palace for the barbiton. His barbiton, it
      was his elder child! He had another child, and now we must turn to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      How shall I describe thee, Viola? Certainly the music had something to
      answer for in the advent of that young stranger. For both in her form and
      her character you might have traced a family likeness to that singular and
      spirit-like life of sound which night after night threw itself in airy and
      goblin sport over the starry seas...Beautiful she was, but of a very
      uncommon beauty,&mdash;a combination, a harmony of opposite attributes.
      Her hair of a gold richer and purer than that which is seen even in the
      North; but the eyes, of all the dark, tender, subduing light of more than
      Italian&mdash;almost of Oriental&mdash;splendour. The complexion
      exquisitely fair, but never the same,&mdash;vivid in one moment, pale the
      next. And with the complexion, the expression also varied; nothing now so
      sad, and nothing now so joyous.
    </p>
    <p>
      I grieve to say that what we rightly entitle education was much neglected
      for their daughter by this singular pair. To be sure, neither of them had
      much knowledge to bestow; and knowledge was not then the fashion, as it is
      now. But accident or nature favoured young Viola. She learned, as of
      course, her mother&rsquo;s language with her father&rsquo;s. And she contrived soon to
      read and to write; and her mother, who, by the way, was a Roman Catholic,
      taught her betimes to pray. But then, to counteract all these
      acquisitions, the strange habits of Pisani, and the incessant watch and
      care which he required from his wife, often left the child alone with an
      old nurse, who, to be sure, loved her dearly, but who was in no way
      calculated to instruct her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dame Gionetta was every inch Italian and Neapolitan. Her youth had been
      all love, and her age was all superstition. She was garrulous, fond,&mdash;a
      gossip. Now she would prattle to the girl of cavaliers and princes at her
      feet, and now she would freeze her blood with tales and legends, perhaps
      as old as Greek or Etrurian fable, of demon and vampire,&mdash;of the
      dances round the great walnut-tree at Benevento, and the haunting spell of
      the Evil Eye. All this helped silently to weave charmed webs over Viola&rsquo;s
      imagination that afterthought and later years might labour vainly to
      dispel. And all this especially fitted her to hang, with a fearful joy,
      upon her father&rsquo;s music. Those visionary strains, ever struggling to
      translate into wild and broken sounds the language of unearthly beings,
      breathed around her from her birth. Thus you might have said that her
      whole mind was full of music; associations, memories, sensations of
      pleasure or pain,&mdash;all were mixed up inexplicably with those sounds
      that now delighted and now terrified; that greeted her when her eyes
      opened to the sun, and woke her trembling on her lonely couch in the
      darkness of the night. The legends and tales of Gionetta only served to
      make the child better understand the signification of those mysterious
      tones; they furnished her with words to the music. It was natural that the
      daughter of such a parent should soon evince some taste in his art. But
      this developed itself chiefly in the ear and the voice. She was yet a
      child when she sang divinely. A great Cardinal&mdash;great alike in the
      State and the Conservatorio&mdash;heard of her gifts, and sent for her.
      From that moment her fate was decided: she was to be the future glory of
      Naples, the prima donna of San Carlo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cardinal insisted upon the accomplishment of his own predictions, and
      provided her with the most renowned masters. To inspire her with
      emulation, his Eminence took her one evening to his own box: it would be
      something to see the performance, something more to hear the applause
      lavished upon the glittering signoras she was hereafter to excel! Oh, how
      gloriously that life of the stage, that fairy world of music and song,
      dawned upon her! It was the only world that seemed to correspond with her
      strange childish thoughts. It appeared to her as if, cast hitherto on a
      foreign shore, she was brought at last to see the forms and hear the
      language of her native land. Beautiful and true enthusiasm, rich with the
      promise of genius! Boy or man, thou wilt never be a poet, if thou hast not
      felt the ideal, the romance, the Calypso&rsquo;s isle that opened to thee when
      for the first time the magic curtain was drawn aside, and let in the world
      of poetry on the world of prose!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the initiation was begun. She was to read, to study, to depict by
      a gesture, a look, the passions she was to delineate on the boards;
      lessons dangerous, in truth, to some, but not to the pure enthusiasm that
      comes from art; for the mind that rightly conceives art is but a mirror
      which gives back what is cast on its surface faithfully only&mdash;while
      unsullied. She seized on nature and truth intuitively. Her recitations
      became full of unconscious power; her voice moved the heart to tears, or
      warmed it into generous rage. But this arose from that sympathy which
      genius ever has, even in its earliest innocence, with whatever feels, or
      aspires, or suffers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no premature woman comprehending the love or the jealousy that the
      words expressed; her art was one of those strange secrets which the
      psychologists may unriddle to us if they please, and tell us why children
      of the simplest minds and the purest hearts are often so acute to
      distinguish, in the tales you tell them, or the songs you sing, the
      difference between the true art and the false, passion and jargon, Homer
      and Racine,&mdash;echoing back, from hearts that have not yet felt what
      they repeat, the melodious accents of the natural pathos. Apart from her
      studies, Viola was a simple, affectionate, but somewhat wayward child,&mdash;wayward,
      not in temper, for that was sweet and docile; but in her moods, which, as
      I before hinted, changed from sad to gay and gay to sad without an
      apparent cause. If cause there were, it must be traced to the early and
      mysterious influences I have referred to, when seeking to explain the
      effect produced on her imagination by those restless streams of sound that
      constantly played around it; for it is noticeable that to those who are
      much alive to the effects of music, airs and tunes often come back, in the
      commonest pursuits of life, to vex, as it were, and haunt them. The music,
      once admitted to the soul, becomes also a sort of spirit, and never dies.
      It wanders perturbedly through the halls and galleries of the memory, and
      is often heard again, distinct and living as when it first displaced the
      wavelets of the air. Now at times, then, these phantoms of sound floated
      back upon her fancy; if gay, to call a smile from every dimple; if
      mournful, to throw a shade upon her brow,&mdash;to make her cease from her
      childishmirth, and sit apart and muse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rightly, then, in a typical sense, might this fair creature, so airy in
      her shape, so harmonious in her beauty, so unfamiliar in her ways and
      thoughts,&mdash;rightly might she be called a daughter, less of the
      musician than the music, a being for whom you could imagine that some fate
      was reserved, less of actual life than the romance which, to eyes that can
      see, and hearts that can feel, glides ever along WITH the actual life,
      stream by stream, to the Dark Ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      And therefore it seemed not strange that Viola herself, even in childhood,
      and yet more as she bloomed into the sweet seriousness of virgin youth,
      should fancy her life ordained for a lot, whether of bliss or woe, that
      should accord with the romance and reverie which made the atmosphere she
      breathed. Frequently she would climb through the thickets that clothed the
      neighbouring grotto of Posilipo,&mdash;the mighty work of the old
      Cimmerians,&mdash;and, seated by the haunted Tomb of Virgil, indulge those
      visions, the subtle vagueness of which no poetry can render palpable and
      defined; for the Poet that surpasses all who ever sang, is the heart of
      dreaming youth! Frequently there, too, beside the threshold over which the
      vine-leaves clung, and facing that dark-blue, waveless sea, she would sit
      in the autumn noon or summer twilight, and build her castles in the air.
      Who doth not do the same,&mdash;not in youth alone, but with the dimmed
      hopes of age! It is man&rsquo;s prerogative to dream, the common royalty of
      peasant and of king. But those day-dreams of hers were more habitual,
      distinct, and solemn than the greater part of us indulge. They seemed like
      the Orama of the Greeks,&mdash;prophets while phantasma.

     Fu stupor, fu vaghezza, fu diletto!
     &ldquo;Gerusal. Lib.,&rdquo; cant. ii. xxi.

       Wiffen&rsquo;s Translation.)
</pre>
    <p>
      Now at last the education is accomplished! Viola is nearly sixteen. The
      Cardinal declares that the time is come when the new name must be
      inscribed in the Libro d&rsquo;Oro,&mdash;the Golden Book set apart to the
      children of Art and Song. Yes, but in what character?&mdash;to whose
      genius is she to give embodiment and form? Ah, there is the secret!
      Rumours go abroad that the inexhaustible Paisiello, charmed with her
      performance of his &ldquo;Nel cor piu non me sento,&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Io son Lindoro,&rdquo;
       will produce some new masterpiece to introduce the debutante. Others
      insist upon it that her forte is the comic, and that Cimarosa is hard at
      work at another &ldquo;Matrimonia Segreto.&rdquo; But in the meanwhile there is a
      check in the diplomacy somewhere. The Cardinal is observed to be out of
      humour. He has said publicly,&mdash;and the words are portentous,&mdash;&ldquo;The
      silly girl is as mad as her father; what she asks is preposterous!&rdquo;
       Conference follows conference; the Cardinal talks to the poor child very
      solemnly in his closet,&mdash;all in vain. Naples is distracted with
      curiosity and conjecture. The lecture ends in a quarrel, and Viola comes
      home sullen and pouting: she will not act,&mdash;she has renounced the
      engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pisani, too inexperienced to be aware of all the dangers of the stage, had
      been pleased at the notion that one, at least, of his name would add
      celebrity to his art. The girl&rsquo;s perverseness displeased him. However, he
      said nothing,&mdash;he never scolded in words, but he took up the faithful
      barbiton. Oh, faithful barbiton, how horribly thou didst scold! It
      screeched, it gabbled, it moaned, it growled. And Viola&rsquo;s eyes filled with
      tears, for she understood that language. She stole to her mother, and
      whispered in her ear; and when Pisani turned from his employment, lo! both
      mother and daughter were weeping. He looked at them with a wondering
      stare; and then, as if he felt he had been harsh, he flew again to his
      Familiar. And now you thought you heard the lullaby which a fairy might
      sing to some fretful changeling it had adopted and sought to soothe.
      Liquid, low, silvery, streamed the tones beneath the enchanted bow. The
      most stubborn grief would have paused to hear; and withal, at times, out
      came a wild, merry, ringing note, like a laugh, but not mortal laughter.
      It was one of his most successful airs from his beloved opera,&mdash;the
      Siren in the act of charming the waves and the winds to sleep. Heaven
      knows what next would have come, but his arm was arrested. Viola had
      thrown herself on his breast, and kissed him, with happy eyes that smiled
      through her sunny hair. At that very moment the door opened,&mdash;a
      message from the Cardinal. Viola must go to his Eminence at once. Her
      mother went with her. All was reconciled and settled; Viola had her way,
      and selected her own opera. O ye dull nations of the North, with your
      broils and debates,&mdash;your bustling lives of the Pnyx and the Agora!&mdash;you
      cannot guess what a stir throughout musical Naples was occasioned by the
      rumour of a new opera and a new singer. But whose the opera? No cabinet
      intrigue ever was so secret. Pisani came back one night from the theatre,
      evidently disturbed and irate. Woe to thine ears hadst thou heard the
      barbiton that night! They had suspended him from his office,&mdash;they
      feared that the new opera, and the first debut of his daughter as prima
      donna, would be too much for his nerves. And his variations, his diablerie
      of sirens and harpies, on such a night, made a hazard not to be
      contemplated without awe. To be set aside, and on the very night that his
      child, whose melody was but an emanation of his own, was to perform,&mdash;set
      aside for some new rival: it was too much for a musician&rsquo;s flesh and
      blood. For the first time he spoke in words upon the subject, and gravely
      asked&mdash;for that question the barbiton, eloquent as it was, could not
      express distinctly&mdash;what was to be the opera, and what the part? And
      Viola as gravely answered that she was pledged to the Cardinal not to
      reveal. Pisani said nothing, but disappeared with the violin; and
      presently they heard the Familiar from the house-top (whither, when
      thoroughly out of humour, the musician sometimes fled), whining and
      sighing as if its heart were broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affections of Pisani were little visible on the surface. He was not
      one of those fond, caressing fathers whose children are ever playing round
      their knees; his mind and soul were so thoroughly in his art that domestic
      life glided by him, seemingly as if THAT were a dream, and the heart the
      substantial form and body of existence. Persons much cultivating an
      abstract study are often thus; mathematicians proverbially so. When his
      servant ran to the celebrated French philosopher, shrieking, &ldquo;The house is
      on fire, sir!&rdquo; &ldquo;Go and tell my wife then, fool!&rdquo; said the wise man,
      settling back to his problems; &ldquo;do <i>I</i> ever meddle with domestic
      affairs?&rdquo; But what are mathematics to music&mdash;music, that not only
      composes operas, but plays on the barbiton? Do you know what the
      illustrious Giardini said when the tyro asked how long it would take to
      learn to play on the violin? Hear, and despair, ye who would bend the bow
      to which that of Ulysses was a plaything, &ldquo;Twelve hours a day for twenty
      years together!&rdquo; Can a man, then, who plays the barbiton be always playing
      also with his little ones? No, Pisani; often, with the keen susceptibility
      of childhood, poor Viola had stolen from the room to weep at the thought
      that thou didst not love her. And yet, underneath this outward abstraction
      of the artist, the natural fondness flowed all the same; and as she grew
      up, the dreamer had understood the dreamer. And now, shut out from all
      fame himself; to be forbidden to hail even his daughter&rsquo;s fame!&mdash;and
      that daughter herself to be in the conspiracy against him! Sharper than
      the serpent&rsquo;s tooth was the ingratitude, and sharper than the serpent&rsquo;s
      tooth was the wail of the pitying barbiton!
    </p>
    <p>
      The eventful hour is come. Viola is gone to the theatre,&mdash;her mother
      with her. The indignant musician remains at home. Gionetta bursts into the
      room: my Lord Cardinal&rsquo;s carriage is at the door,&mdash;the Padrone is
      sent for. He must lay aside his violin; he must put on his brocade coat
      and his lace ruffles. Here they are,&mdash;quick, quick! And quick rolls
      the gilded coach, and majestic sits the driver, and statelily prance the
      steeds. Poor Pisani is lost in a mist of uncomfortable amaze. He arrives
      at the theatre; he descends at the great door; he turns round and round,
      and looks about him and about: he misses something,&mdash;where is the
      violin? Alas! his soul, his voice, his self of self, is left behind! It is
      but an automaton that the lackeys conduct up the stairs, through the tier,
      into the Cardinal&rsquo;s box. But then, what bursts upon him! Does he dream?
      The first act is over (they did not send for him till success seemed no
      longer doubtful); the first act has decided all. He feels THAT by the
      electric sympathy which ever the one heart has at once with a vast
      audience. He feels it by the breathless stillness of that multitude; he
      feels it even by the lifted finger of the Cardinal. He sees his Viola on
      the stage, radiant in her robes and gems,&mdash;he hears her voice
      thrilling through the single heart of the thousands! But the scene, the
      part, the music! It is his other child,&mdash;his immortal child; the
      spirit-infant of his soul; his darling of many years of patient obscurity
      and pining genius; his masterpiece; his opera of the Siren!
    </p>
    <p>
      This, then, was the mystery that had so galled him,&mdash;this the cause
      of the quarrel with the Cardinal; this the secret not to be proclaimed
      till the success was won, and the daughter had united her father&rsquo;s triumph
      with her own! And there she stands, as all souls bow before her,&mdash;fairer
      than the very Siren he had called from the deeps of melody. Oh, long and
      sweet recompense of toil! Where is on earth the rapture like that which is
      known to genius when at last it bursts from its hidden cavern into light
      and fame!
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not speak, he did not move; he stood transfixed, breathless, the
      tears rolling down his cheeks; only from time to time his hands still
      wandered about,&mdash;mechanically they sought for the faithful
      instrument, why was it not there to share his triumph?
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the curtain fell; but on such a storm and diapason of applause! Up
      rose the audience as one man, as with one voice that dear name was
      shouted. She came on, trembling, pale, and in the whole crowd saw but her
      father&rsquo;s face. The audience followed those moistened eyes; they recognised
      with a thrill the daughter&rsquo;s impulse and her meaning. The good old
      Cardinal drew him gently forward. Wild musician, thy daughter has given
      thee back more than the life thou gavest!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor violin!&rdquo; said he, wiping his eyes, &ldquo;they will never hiss thee
      again now!&rdquo;

    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Fra si contrarie tempre in ghiaccio e in foco,
     In riso e in pianto, e fra paura e speme
     L&rsquo;ingannatrice Donna&mdash;
     &ldquo;Gerusal. Lib.,&rdquo; cant. iv. xciv.

     (Between such contrarious mixtures of ice and fire, laughter and
     tears,&mdash;fear and hope, the deceiving dame.)
</pre>
    <p>
      Now notwithstanding the triumph both of the singer and the opera, there
      had been one moment in the first act, and, consequently, BEFORE the
      arrival of Pisani, when the scale seemed more than doubtful. It was in a
      chorus replete with all the peculiarities of the composer. And when the
      Maelstrom of Capricci whirled and foamed, and tore ear and sense through
      every variety of sound, the audience simultaneously recognised the hand of
      Pisani. A title had been given to the opera which had hitherto prevented
      all suspicion of its parentage; and the overture and opening, in which the
      music had been regular and sweet, had led the audience to fancy they
      detected the genius of their favourite Paisiello. Long accustomed to
      ridicule and almost to despise the pretensions of Pisani as a composer,
      they now felt as if they had been unduly cheated into the applause with
      which they had hailed the overture and the commencing scenas. An ominous
      buzz circulated round the house: the singers, the orchestra,&mdash;electrically
      sensitive to the impression of the audience,&mdash;grew, themselves,
      agitated and dismayed, and failed in the energy and precision which could
      alone carry off the grotesqueness of the music.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are always in every theatre many rivals to a new author and a new
      performer,&mdash;a party impotent while all goes well, but a dangerous
      ambush the instant some accident throws into confusion the march of
      success. A hiss arose; it was partial, it is true, but the significant
      silence of all applause seemed to forebode the coming moment when the
      displeasure would grow contagious. It was the breath that stirred the
      impending avalanche. At that critical moment Viola, the Siren queen,
      emerged for the first time from her ocean cave. As she came forward to the
      lamps, the novelty of her situation, the chilling apathy of the audience,&mdash;which
      even the sight of so singular a beauty did not at the first arouse,&mdash;the
      whispers of the malignant singers on the stage, the glare of the lights,
      and more&mdash;far more than the rest&mdash;that recent hiss, which had
      reached her in her concealment, all froze up her faculties and suspended
      her voice. And, instead of the grand invocation into which she ought
      rapidly to have burst, the regal Siren, retransformed into the trembling
      girl, stood pale and mute before the stern, cold array of those countless
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant, and when consciousness itself seemed about to fail her,
      as she turned a timid beseeching glance around the still multitude, she
      perceived, in a box near the stage, a countenance which at once, and like
      magic, produced on her mind an effect never to be analysed nor forgotten.
      It was one that awakened an indistinct, haunting reminiscence, as if she
      had seen it in those day-dreams she had been so wont from infancy to
      indulge. She could not withdraw her gaze from that face, and as she gazed,
      the awe and coldness that had before seized her, vanished like a mist from
      before the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dark splendour of the eyes that met her own there was indeed so
      much of gentle encouragement, of benign and compassionate admiration,&mdash;so
      much that warmed, and animated, and nerved,&mdash;that any one, actor or
      orator, who has ever observed the effect that a single earnest and kindly
      look in the crowd that is to be addressed and won, will produce upon his
      mind, may readily account for the sudden and inspiriting influence which
      the eye and smile of the stranger exercised on the debutante.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while yet she gazed, and the glow returned to her heart, the stranger
      half rose, as if to recall the audience to a sense of the courtesy due to
      one so fair and young; and the instant his voice gave the signal, the
      audience followed it by a burst of generous applause. For this stranger
      himself was a marked personage, and his recent arrival at Naples had
      divided with the new opera the gossip of the city. And then as the
      applause ceased, clear, full, and freed from every fetter, like a spirit
      from the clay, the Siren&rsquo;s voice poured forth its entrancing music. From
      that time Viola forgot the crowd, the hazard, the whole world,&mdash;except
      the fairy one over with she presided. It seemed that the stranger&rsquo;s
      presence only served still more to heighten that delusion, in which the
      artist sees no creation without the circle of his art, she felt as if that
      serene brow, and those brilliant eyes, inspired her with powers never
      known before: and, as if searching for a language to express the strange
      sensations occasioned by his presence, that presence itself whispered to
      her the melody and the song.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only when all was over, and she saw her father and felt his joy, did this
      wild spell vanish before the sweeter one of the household and filial love.
      Yet again, as she turned from the stage, she looked back involuntarily,
      and the stranger&rsquo;s calm and half-melancholy smile sank into her heart,&mdash;to
      live there, to be recalled with confused memories, half of pleasure, and
      half of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pass over the congratulations of the good Cardinal-Virtuoso, astonished at
      finding himself and all Naples had been hitherto in the wrong on a subject
      of taste,&mdash;still more astonished at finding himself and all Naples
      combining to confess it; pass over the whispered ecstasies of admiration
      which buzzed in the singer&rsquo;s ear, as once more, in her modest veil and
      quiet dress, she escaped from the crowd of gallants that choked up every
      avenue behind the scenes; pass over the sweet embrace of father and child,
      returning through the starlit streets and along the deserted Chiaja in the
      Cardinal&rsquo;s carriage; never pause now to note the tears and ejaculations of
      the good, simple-hearted mother,&mdash;see them returned; see the
      well-known room, venimus ad larem nostrum (We come to our own house.); see
      old Gionetta bustling at the supper; and hear Pisani, as he rouses the
      barbiton from its case, communicating all that has happened to the
      intelligent Familiar; hark to the mother&rsquo;s merry, low, English laugh. Why,
      Viola, strange child, sittest thou apart, thy face leaning on thy fair
      hands, thine eyes fixed on space? Up, rouse thee! Every dimple on the
      cheek of home must smile to-night. (&ldquo;Ridete quidquid est domi
      cachinnorum.&rdquo; Catull. &ldquo;ad Sirm. Penin.&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      And a happy reunion it was round that humble table: a feast Lucullus might
      have envied in his Hall of Apollo, in the dried grapes, and the dainty
      sardines, and the luxurious polenta, and the old lacrima a present from
      the good Cardinal. The barbiton, placed on a chair&mdash;a tall,
      high-backed chair&mdash;beside the musician, seemed to take a part in the
      festive meal. Its honest varnished face glowed in the light of the lamp;
      and there was an impish, sly demureness in its very silence, as its
      master, between every mouthful, turned to talk to it of something he had
      forgotten to relate before. The good wife looked on affectionately, and
      could not eat for joy; but suddenly she rose, and placed on the artist&rsquo;s
      temples a laurel wreath, which she had woven beforehand in fond
      anticipation; and Viola, on the other side her brother, the barbiton,
      rearranged the chaplet, and, smoothing back her father&rsquo;s hair, whispered,
      &ldquo;Caro Padre, you will not let HIM scold me again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then poor Pisani, rather distracted between the two, and excited both by
      the lacrima and his triumph, turned to the younger child with so naive and
      grotesque a pride, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know which to thank the most. You give me so
      much joy, child,&mdash;I am so proud of thee and myself. But he and I,
      poor fellow, have been so often unhappy together!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Viola&rsquo;s sleep was broken,&mdash;that was natural. The intoxication of
      vanity and triumph, the happiness in the happiness she had caused, all
      this was better than sleep. But still from all this, again and again her
      thoughts flew to those haunting eyes, to that smile with which forever the
      memory of the triumph, of the happiness, was to be united. Her feelings,
      like her own character, were strange and peculiar. They were not those of
      a girl whose heart, for the first time reached through the eye, sighs its
      natural and native language of first love. It was not so much admiration,
      though the face that reflected itself on every wave of her restless
      fancies was of the rarest order of majesty and beauty; nor a pleased and
      enamoured recollection that the sight of this stranger had bequeathed: it
      was a human sentiment of gratitude and delight, mixed with something more
      mysterious, of fear and awe. Certainly she had seen before those features;
      but when and how? Only when her thoughts had sought to shape out her
      future, and when, in spite of all the attempts to vision forth a fate of
      flowers and sunshine, a dark and chill foreboding made her recoil back
      into her deepest self. It was a something found that had long been sought
      for by a thousand restless yearnings and vague desires, less of the heart
      than mind; not as when youth discovers the one to be beloved, but rather
      as when the student, long wandering after the clew to some truth in
      science, sees it glimmer dimly before him, to beckon, to recede, to
      allure, and to wane again. She fell at last into unquiet slumber, vexed by
      deformed, fleeting, shapeless phantoms; and, waking, as the sun, through a
      veil of hazy cloud, glinted with a sickly ray across the casement, she
      heard her father settled back betimes to his one pursuit, and calling
      forth from his Familiar a low mournful strain, like a dirge over the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why,&rdquo; she asked, when she descended to the room below,&mdash;&ldquo;why, my
      father, was your inspiration so sad, after the joy of last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not, child. I meant to be merry, and compose an air in honour of
      thee; but he is an obstinate fellow, this,&mdash;and he would have it so.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER 1.IV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     E cosi i pigri e timidi desiri
     Sprona.
     &ldquo;Gerusal. Lib.,&rdquo; cant. iv. lxxxviii.

     (And thus the slow and timid passions urged.)
</pre>
    <p>
      It was the custom of Pisani, except when the duties of his profession made
      special demand on his time, to devote a certain portion of the mid-day to
      sleep,&mdash;a habit not so much a luxury as a necessity to a man who
      slept very little during the night. In fact, whether to compose or to
      practice, the hours of noon were precisely those in which Pisani could not
      have been active if he would. His genius resembled those fountains full at
      dawn and evening, overflowing at night, and perfectly dry at the meridian.
      During this time, consecrated by her husband to repose, the signora
      generally stole out to make the purchases necessary for the little
      household, or to enjoy (as what woman does not?) a little relaxation in
      gossip with some of her own sex. And the day following this brilliant
      triumph, how many congratulations would she have to receive!
    </p>
    <p>
      At these times it was Viola&rsquo;s habit to seat herself without the door of
      the house, under an awning which sheltered from the sun without
      obstructing the view; and there now, with the prompt-book on her knee, on
      which her eye roves listlessly from time to time, you may behold her, the
      vine-leaves clustering from their arching trellis over the door behind,
      and the lazy white-sailed boats skimming along the sea that stretched
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she thus sat, rather in reverie than thought, a man coming from the
      direction of Posilipo, with a slow step and downcast eyes, passed close by
      the house, and Viola, looking up abruptly, started in a kind of terror as
      she recognised the stranger. She uttered an involuntary exclamation, and
      the cavalier turning, saw, and paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood a moment or two between her and the sunlit ocean, contemplating
      in a silence too serious and gentle for the boldness of gallantry, the
      blushing face and the young slight form before him; at length he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you happy, my child,&rdquo; he said, in almost a paternal tone, &ldquo;at the
      career that lies before you? From sixteen to thirty, the music in the
      breath of applause is sweeter than all the music your voice can utter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; replied Viola, falteringly, but encouraged by the liquid
      softness of the accents that addressed her,&mdash;&ldquo;I know not whether I am
      happy now, but I was last night. And I feel, too, Excellency, that I have
      you to thank, though, perhaps, you scarce know why!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You deceive yourself,&rdquo; said the cavalier, with a smile. &ldquo;I am aware that
      I assisted to your merited success, and it is you who scarce know how. The
      WHY I will tell you: because I saw in your heart a nobler ambition than
      that of the woman&rsquo;s vanity; it was the daughter that interested me.
      Perhaps you would rather I should have admired the singer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; oh, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I believe you. And now, since we have thus met, I will pause to
      counsel you. When next you go to the theatre, you will have at your feet
      all the young gallants of Naples. Poor infant! the flame that dazzles the
      eye can scorch the wing. Remember that the only homage that does not sully
      must be that which these gallants will not give thee. And whatever thy
      dreams of the future,&mdash;and I see, while I speak to thee, how
      wandering they are, and wild,&mdash;may only those be fulfilled which
      centre round the hearth of home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, as Viola&rsquo;s breast heaved beneath its robe. And with a burst of
      natural and innocent emotions, scarcely comprehending, though an Italian,
      the grave nature of his advice, she exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Excellency, you cannot know how dear to me that home is already. And
      my father,&mdash;there would be no home, signor, without him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A deep and melancholy shade settled over the face of the cavalier. He
      looked up at the quiet house buried amidst the vine-leaves, and turned
      again to the vivid, animated face of the young actress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;A simple heart may be its own best guide, and so,
      go on, and prosper. Adieu, fair singer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu, Excellency; but,&rdquo; and something she could not resist&mdash;an
      anxious, sickening feeling of fear and hope,&mdash;impelled her to the
      question, &ldquo;I shall see you again, shall I not, at San Carlo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not, at least, for some time. I leave Naples to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; and Viola&rsquo;s heart sank within her; the poetry of the stage was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said the cavalier, turning back, and gently laying his hand on
      hers,&mdash;&ldquo;and, perhaps, before we meet, you may have suffered: known
      the first sharp griefs of human life,&mdash;known how little what fame can
      gain, repays what the heart can lose; but be brave and yield not,&mdash;not
      even to what may seem the piety of sorrow. Observe yon tree in your
      neighbour&rsquo;s garden. Look how it grows up, crooked and distorted. Some wind
      scattered the germ from which it sprang, in the clefts of the rock; choked
      up and walled round by crags and buildings, by Nature and man, its life
      has been one struggle for the light,&mdash;light which makes to that life
      the necessity and the principle: you see how it has writhed and twisted;
      how, meeting the barrier in one spot, it has laboured and worked, stem and
      branches, towards the clear skies at last. What has preserved it through
      each disfavour of birth and circumstances,&mdash;why are its leaves as
      green and fair as those of the vine behind you, which, with all its arms,
      can embrace the open sunshine? My child, because of the very instinct that
      impelled the struggle,&mdash;because the labour for the light won to the
      light at length. So with a gallant heart, through every adverse accident
      of sorrow and of fate to turn to the sun, to strive for the heaven; this
      it is that gives knowledge to the strong and happiness to the weak. Ere we
      meet again, you will turn sad and heavy eyes to those quiet boughs, and
      when you hear the birds sing from them, and see the sunshine come aslant
      from crag and housetop to be the playfellow of their leaves, learn the
      lesson that Nature teaches you, and strive through darkness to the light!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he moved on slowly, and left Viola wondering, silent, saddened
      with his dim prophecy of coming evil, and yet, through sadness, charmed.
      Involuntarily her eyes followed him,&mdash;involuntarily she stretched
      forth her arms, as if by a gesture to call him back; she would have given
      worlds to have seen him turn,&mdash;to have heard once more his low, calm,
      silvery voice; to have felt again the light touch of his hand on hers. As
      moonlight that softens into beauty every angle on which it falls, seemed
      his presence,&mdash;as moonlight vanishes, and things assume their common
      aspect of the rugged and the mean, he receded from her eyes, and the
      outward scene was commonplace once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger passed on, through that long and lovely road which reaches at
      last the palaces that face the public gardens, and conducts to the more
      populous quarters of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      A group of young, dissipated courtiers, loitering by the gateway of a
      house which was open for the favourite pastime of the day,&mdash;the
      resort of the wealthier and more high-born gamesters,&mdash;made way for
      him, as with a courteous inclination he passed them by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Per fede,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;is not that the rich Zanoni, of whom the town
      talks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay; they say his wealth is incalculable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;THEY say,&mdash;who are THEY?&mdash;what is the authority? He has not
      been many days at Naples, and I cannot yet find any one who knows aught of
      his birthplace, his parentage, or, what is more important, his estates!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true; but he arrived in a goodly vessel, which THEY SAY is his
      own. See,&mdash;no, you cannot see it here; but it rides yonder in the
      bay. The bankers he deals with speak with awe of the sums placed in their
      hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whence came he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From some seaport in the East. My valet learned from some of the sailors
      on the Mole that he had resided many years in the interior of India.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I am told that in India men pick up gold like pebbles, and that there
      are valleys where the birds build their nests with emeralds to attract the
      moths. Here comes our prince of gamesters, Cetoxa; be sure that he already
      must have made acquaintance with so wealthy a cavalier; he has that
      attraction to gold which the magnet has to steel. Well, Cetoxa, what fresh
      news of the ducats of Signor Zanoni?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Cetoxa, carelessly, &ldquo;my friend&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! hear him; his friend&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; my friend Zanoni is going to Rome for a short time; when he returns,
      he has promised me to fix a day to sup with me, and I will then introduce
      him to you, and to the best society of Naples! Diavolo! but he is a most
      agreeable and witty gentleman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray tell us how you came so suddenly to be his friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Belgioso, nothing more natural. He desired a box at San Carlo;
      but I need not tell you that the expectation of a new opera (ah, how
      superb it is,&mdash;that poor devil, Pisani; who would have thought it?)
      and a new singer (what a face,&mdash;what a voice!&mdash;ah!) had engaged
      every corner of the house. I heard of Zanoni&rsquo;s desire to honour the talent
      of Naples, and, with my usual courtesy to distinguished strangers, I sent
      to place my box at his disposal. He accepts it,&mdash;I wait on him
      between the acts; he is most charming; he invites me to supper. Cospetto,
      what a retinue! We sit late,&mdash;I tell him all the news of Naples; we
      grow bosom friends; he presses on me this diamond before we part,&mdash;is
      a trifle, he tells me: the jewellers value it at 5000 pistoles!&mdash;the
      merriest evening I have passed these ten years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cavaliers crowded round to admire the diamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signor Count Cetoxa,&rdquo; said one grave-looking sombre man, who had crossed
      himself two or three times during the Neapolitan&rsquo;s narrative, &ldquo;are you not
      aware of the strange reports about this person; and are you not afraid to
      receive from him a gift which may carry with it the most fatal
      consequences? Do you not know that he is said to be a sorcerer; to possess
      the mal-occhio; to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prithee, spare us your antiquated superstitions,&rdquo; interrupted Cetoxa,
      contemptuously. &ldquo;They are out of fashion; nothing now goes down but
      scepticism and philosophy. And what, after all, do these rumours, when
      sifted, amount to? They have no origin but this,&mdash;a silly old man of
      eighty-six, quite in his dotage, solemnly avers that he saw this same
      Zanoni seventy years ago (he himself, the narrator, then a mere boy) at
      Milan; when this very Zanoni, as you all see, is at least as young as you
      or I, Belgioso.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that,&rdquo; said the grave gentleman,&mdash;&ldquo;THAT is the mystery. Old
      Avelli declares that Zanoni does not seem a day older than when they met
      at Milan. He says that even then at Milan&mdash;mark this&mdash;where,
      though under another name, this Zanoni appeared in the same splendour, he
      was attended also by the same mystery. And that an old man THERE
      remembered to have seen him sixty years before, in Sweden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tush,&rdquo; returned Cetoxa, &ldquo;the same thing has been said of the quack
      Cagliostro,&mdash;mere fables. I will believe them when I see this diamond
      turn to a wisp of hay. For the rest,&rdquo; he added gravely, &ldquo;I consider this
      illustrious gentleman my friend; and a whisper against his honour and
      repute will in future be equivalent to an affront to myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cetoxa was a redoubted swordsman, and excelled in a peculiarly awkward
      manoeuvre, which he himself had added to the variations of the stoccata.
      The grave gentleman, however anxious for the spiritual weal of the count,
      had an equal regard for his own corporeal safety. He contented himself
      with a look of compassion, and, turning through the gateway, ascended the
      stairs to the gaming-tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; said Cetoxa, laughing, &ldquo;our good Loredano is envious of my
      diamond. Gentlemen, you sup with me to-night. I assure you I never met a
      more delightful, sociable, entertaining person, than my dear friend the
      Signor Zanoni.&rdquo;

     Quello Ippogifo, grande e strano augello
     Lo porta via.
     &ldquo;Orlando Furioso,&rdquo; c. vi. xviii.

     (That hippogriff, great and marvellous bird, bears him away.)
</pre>
    <p>
      And now, accompanying this mysterious Zanoni, am I compelled to bid a
      short farewell to Naples. Mount behind me,&mdash;mount on my hippogriff,
      reader; settle yourself at your ease. I bought the pillion the other day
      of a poet who loves his comfort; it has been newly stuffed for your
      special accommodation. So, so, we ascend! Look as we ride aloft,&mdash;look!&mdash;never
      fear, hippogriffs never stumble; and every hippogriff in Italy is
      warranted to carry elderly gentlemen,&mdash;look down on the gliding
      landscapes! There, near the ruins of the Oscan&rsquo;s old Atella, rises Aversa,
      once the stronghold of the Norman; there gleam the columns of Capua, above
      the Vulturnian Stream. Hail to ye, cornfields and vineyards famous for the
      old Falernian! Hail to ye, golden orange-groves of Mola di Gaeta! Hail to
      ye, sweet shrubs and wild flowers, omnis copia narium, that clothe the
      mountain-skirts of the silent Lautulae! Shall we rest at the Volscian
      Anxur,&mdash;the modern Terracina,&mdash;where the lofty rock stands like
      the giant that guards the last borders of the southern land of love? Away,
      away! and hold your breath as we flit above the Pontine Marshes. Dreary
      and desolate, their miasma is to the gardens we have passed what the rank
      commonplace of life is to the heart when it has left love behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mournful Campagna, thou openest on us in majestic sadness. Rome,
      seven-hilled Rome! receive us as Memory receives the way-worn; receive us
      in silence, amidst ruins! Where is the traveller we pursue? Turn the
      hippogriff loose to graze: he loves the acanthus that wreathes round yon
      broken columns. Yes, that is the arch of Titus, the conqueror of
      Jerusalem,&mdash;that the Colosseum! Through one passed the triumph of the
      deified invader; in one fell the butchered gladiators. Monuments of
      murder, how poor the thoughts, how mean the memories ye awaken, compared
      with those that speak to the heart of man on the heights of Phyle, or by
      thy lone mound, grey Marathon! We stand amidst weeds and brambles and long
      waving herbage. Where we stand reigned Nero,&mdash;here were his
      tessellated floors; here,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mighty in the heaven, a second heaven,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      hung the vault of his ivory roofs; here, arch upon arch, pillar on pillar,
      glittered to the world the golden palace of its master,&mdash;the Golden
      House of Nero. How the lizard watches us with his bright, timorous eye! We
      disturb his reign. Gather that wild flower: the Golden House is vanished,
      but the wild flower may have kin to those which the stranger&rsquo;s hand
      scattered over the tyrant&rsquo;s grave; see, over this soil, the grave of Rome,
      Nature strews the wild flowers still!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this desolation is an old building of the middle ages.
      Here dwells a singular recluse. In the season of the malaria the native
      peasant flies the rank vegetation round; but he, a stranger and a
      foreigner, no associates, no companions, except books and instruments of
      science. He is often seen wandering over the grass-grown hills, or
      sauntering through the streets of the new city, not with the absent brow
      and incurious air of students, but with observant piercing eyes that seem
      to dive into the hearts of the passers-by. An old man, but not infirm,&mdash;erect
      and stately, as if in his prime. None know whether he be rich or poor. He
      asks no charity, and he gives none,&mdash;he does no evil, and seems to
      confer no good. He is a man who appears to have no world beyond himself;
      but appearances are deceitful, and Science, as well as Benevolence, lives
      in the Universe. This abode, for the first time since thus occupied, a
      visitor enters. It is Zanoni.
    </p>
    <p>
      You observe those two men seated together, conversing earnestly. Years
      long and many have flown away since they met last,&mdash;at least, bodily,
      and face to face. But if they are sages, thought can meet thought, and
      spirit spirit, though oceans divide the forms. Death itself divides not
      the wise. Thou meetest Plato when thine eyes moisten over the Phaedo. May
      Homer live with all men forever!
    </p>
    <p>
      They converse; they confess to each other; they conjure up the past, and
      repeople it; but note how differently do such remembrances affect the two.
      On Zanoni&rsquo;s face, despite its habitual calm, the emotions change and go.
      HE has acted in the past he surveys; but not a trace of the humanity that
      participates in joy and sorrow can be detected on the passionless visage
      of his companion; the past, to him, as is now the present, has been but as
      Nature to the sage, the volume to the student,&mdash;a calm and spiritual
      life, a study, a contemplation.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the past they turn to the future. Ah! at the close of the last
      century, the future seemed a thing tangible,&mdash;it was woven up in all
      men&rsquo;s fears and hopes of the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the verge of that hundred years, Man, the ripest born of Time,
    </p>
    <p>
      (&ldquo;An des Jahrhunderts Neige, Der reifste Sohn der Zeit.&rdquo; &ldquo;Die Kunstler.&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      stood as at the deathbed of the Old World, and beheld the New Orb,
      blood-red amidst cloud and vapour,&mdash;uncertain if a comet or a sun.
      Behold the icy and profound disdain on the brow of the old man,&mdash;the
      lofty yet touching sadness that darkens the glorious countenance of
      Zanoni. Is it that one views with contempt the struggle and its issue, and
      the other with awe or pity? Wisdom contemplating mankind leads but to the
      two results,&mdash;compassion or disdain. He who believes in other worlds
      can accustom himself to look on this as the naturalist on the revolutions
      of an ant-hill, or of a leaf. What is the Earth to Infinity,&mdash;what
      its duration to the Eternal? Oh, how much greater is the soul of one man
      than the vicissitudes of the whole globe! Child of heaven, and heir of
      immortality, how from some star hereafter wilt thou look back on the
      ant-hill and its commotions, from Clovis to Robespierre, from Noah to the
      Final Fire. The spirit that can contemplate, that lives only in the
      intellect, can ascend to its star, even from the midst of the
      burial-ground called Earth, and while the sarcophagus called Life immures
      in its clay the everlasting!
    </p>
    <p>
      But thou, Zanoni,&mdash;thou hast refused to live ONLY in the intellect;
      thou hast not mortified the heart; thy pulse still beats with the sweet
      music of mortal passion; thy kind is to thee still something warmer than
      an abstraction,&mdash;thou wouldst look upon this Revolution in its
      cradle, which the storms rock; thou wouldst see the world while its
      elements yet struggle through the chaos!
    </p>
    <p>
      Go!

      CHAPTER 1.VI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Precepteurs ignorans de ce faible univers.&mdash;Voltaire.
     (Ignorant teachers of this weak world.)

     Nous etions a table chez un de nos confreres a l&rsquo;Academie,
     Grand Seigneur et homme d&rsquo;esprit.&mdash;La Harpe.
     (We supped with one of our confreres of the Academy,&mdash;a great
     nobleman and wit.)
</pre>
    <p>
      One evening, at Paris, several months after the date of our last chapter,
      there was a reunion of some of the most eminent wits of the time, at the
      house of a personage distinguished alike by noble birth and liberal
      accomplishments. Nearly all present were of the views that were then the
      mode. For, as came afterwards a time when nothing was so unpopular as the
      people, so that was the time when nothing was so vulgar as aristocracy.
      The airiest fine gentleman and the haughtiest noble prated of equality,
      and lisped enlightenment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the more remarkable guests were Condorcet, then in the prime of his
      reputation, the correspondent of the king of Prussia, the intimate of
      Voltaire, the member of half the academies of Europe,&mdash;noble by
      birth, polished in manners, republican in opinions. There, too, was the
      venerable Malesherbes, &ldquo;l&rsquo;amour et les delices de la Nation.&rdquo; (The idol
      and delight of the nation (so-called by his historian, Gaillard).) There
      Jean Silvain Bailly, the accomplished scholar,&mdash;the aspiring
      politician. It was one of those petits soupers for which the capital of
      all social pleasures was so renowned. The conversation, as might be
      expected, was literary and intellectual, enlivened by graceful pleasantry.
      Many of the ladies of that ancient and proud noblesse&mdash;for the
      noblesse yet existed, though its hours were already numbered&mdash;added
      to the charm of the society; and theirs were the boldest criticisms, and
      often the most liberal sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vain labour for me&mdash;vain labour almost for the grave English language&mdash;to
      do justice to the sparkling paradoxes that flew from lip to lip. The
      favourite theme was the superiority of the moderns to the ancients.
      Condorcet on this head was eloquent, and to some, at least, of his
      audience, most convincing. That Voltaire was greater than Homer few there
      were disposed to deny. Keen was the ridicule lavished on the dull pedantry
      which finds everything ancient necessarily sublime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said the graceful Marquis de &mdash;, as the champagne danced to
      his glass, &ldquo;more ridiculous still is the superstition that finds
      everything incomprehensible holy! But intelligence circulates, Condorcet;
      like water, it finds its level. My hairdresser said to me this morning,
      &lsquo;Though I am but a poor fellow, I believe as little as the finest
      gentleman!&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;Unquestionably, the great Revolution draws near to its final
      completion,&mdash;a pas de geant, as Montesquieu said of his own immortal
      work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there rushed from all&mdash;wit and noble, courtier and republican&mdash;a
      confused chorus, harmonious only in its anticipation of the brilliant
      things to which &ldquo;the great Revolution&rdquo; was to give birth. Here Condrocet
      is more eloquent than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Il faut absolument que la Superstition et le Fanatisme fassent place a la
      Philosophie. (It must necessarily happen that superstition and fanaticism
      give place to philosophy.) Kings persecute persons, priests opinion.
      Without kings, men must be safe; and without priests, minds must be free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; murmured the marquis, &ldquo;and as ce cher Diderot has so well sung,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Et des boyaux du dernier pretre Serrez le cou du dernier roi.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (And throttle the neck of the last king with the string from
     the bowels of the last priest.)
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; resumed Condorcet,&mdash;&ldquo;then commences the Age of Reason!&mdash;equality
      in instruction, equality in institutions, equality in wealth! The great
      impediments to knowledge are, first, the want of a common language; and
      next, the short duration of existence. But as to the first, when all men
      are brothers, why not a universal language? As to the second, the organic
      perfectibility of the vegetable world is undisputed, is Nature less
      powerful in the nobler existence of thinking man? The very destruction of
      the two most active causes of physical deterioration&mdash;here, luxurious
      wealth; there, abject penury,&mdash;must necessarily prolong the general
      term of life. (See Condorcet&rsquo;s posthumous work on the Progress of the
      Human Mind.&mdash;Ed.) The art of medicine will then be honoured in the
      place of war, which is the art of murder: the noblest study of the acutest
      minds will be devoted to the discovery and arrest of the causes of
      disease. Life, I grant, cannot be made eternal; but it may be prolonged
      almost indefinitely. And as the meaner animal bequeaths its vigour to its
      offspring, so man shall transmit his improved organisation, mental and
      physical, to his sons. Oh, yes, to such a consummation does our age
      approach!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The venerable Malesherbes sighed. Perhaps he feared the consummation might
      not come in time for him. The handsome Marquis de &mdash; and the ladies,
      yet handsomer than he, looked conviction and delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      But two men there were, seated next to each other, who joined not in the
      general talk: the one a stranger newly arrived in Paris, where his wealth,
      his person, and his accomplishments, had already made him remarked and
      courted; the other, an old man, somewhere about seventy,&mdash;the witty
      and virtuous, brave, and still light-hearted Cazotte, the author of &ldquo;Le
      Diable Amoureux.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These two conversed familiarly, and apart from the rest, and only by an
      occasional smile testified their attention to the general conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the stranger,&mdash;&ldquo;yes, we have met before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I could not forget your countenance; yet I task in vain my
      recollections of the past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will assist you. Recall the time when, led by curiosity, or perhaps the
      nobler desire of knowledge, you sought initiation into the mysterious
      order of Martines de Pasqualis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (It is so recorded of Cazotte. Of Martines de Pasqualis little is known;
      even the country to which he belonged is matter of conjecture. Equally so
      the rites, ceremonies, and nature of the cabalistic order he established.
      St. Martin was a disciple of the school, and that, at least, is in its
      favour; for in spite of his mysticism, no man more beneficent, generous,
      pure, and virtuous than St. Martin adorned the last century. Above all, no
      man more distinguished himself from the herd of sceptical philosophers by
      the gallantry and fervour with which he combated materialism, and
      vindicated the necessity of faith amidst a chaos of unbelief. It may also
      be observed, that Cazotte, whatever else he learned of the brotherhood of
      Martines, learned nothing that diminished the excellence of his life and
      the sincerity of his religion. At once gentle and brave, he never ceased
      to oppose the excesses of the Revolution. To the last, unlike the Liberals
      of his time, he was a devout and sincere Christian. Before his execution,
      he demanded a pen and paper to write these words: &ldquo;Ma femme, mes enfans,
      ne me pleurez pas; ne m&rsquo;oubliez pas, mais souvenez-vous surtout de ne
      jamais offenser Dieu.&rdquo; (&ldquo;My wife, my children, weep not for me; forget me
      not, but remember above everything never to offend God.)&mdash;Ed.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, is it possible! You are one of that theurgic brotherhood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I attended their ceremonies but to see how vainly they sought to
      revive the ancient marvels of the cabala.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such studies please you? I have shaken off the influence they once had on
      my own imagination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not shaken it off,&rdquo; returned the stranger, bravely; &ldquo;it is on
      you still,&mdash;on you at this hour; it beats in your heart; it kindles
      in your reason; it will speak in your tongue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, with a yet lower voice, the stranger continued to address him,
      to remind him of certain ceremonies and doctrines,&mdash;to explain and
      enforce them by references to the actual experience and history of his
      listener, which Cazotte thrilled to find so familiar to a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually the old man&rsquo;s pleasing and benevolent countenance grew overcast,
      and he turned, from time to time, searching, curious, uneasy glances
      towards his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The charming Duchesse de G&mdash; archly pointed out to the lively guests
      the abstracted air and clouded brow of the poet; and Condorcet, who liked
      no one else to be remarked, when he himself was present, said to Cazotte,
      &ldquo;Well, and what do YOU predict of the Revolution,&mdash;how, at least,
      will it affect us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that question Cazotte started; his cheeks grew pale, large drops stood
      on his forehead; his lips writhed; his gay companions gazed on him in
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; whispered the stranger, laying his hand gently upon the arm of
      the old wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that word Cazotte&rsquo;s face grew locked and rigid, his eyes dwelt vacantly
      on space, and in a low, hollow voice, he thus answered
    </p>
    <p>
      (The following prophecy (not unfamiliar, perhaps, to some of my readers),
      with some slight variations, and at greater length, in the text of the
      authority I am about to cite, is to be found in La Harpe&rsquo;s posthumous
      works. The MS. is said to exist still in La Harpe&rsquo;s handwriting, and the
      story is given on M. Petitot&rsquo;s authority, volume i. page 62. It is not for
      me to enquire if there be doubts of its foundation on fact.&mdash;Ed.),&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask how it will affect yourselves,&mdash;you, its most learned, and
      its least selfish agents. I will answer: you, Marquis de Condorcet, will
      die in prison, but not by the hand of the executioner. In the peaceful
      happiness of that day, the philosopher will carry about with him not the
      elixir but the poison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor Cazotte,&rdquo; said Condorcet, with his gentle smile, &ldquo;what have
      prisons, executioners, and poison to do with an age of liberty and
      brotherhood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is in the names of Liberty and Brotherhood that the prisons will reek,
      and the headsman be glutted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are thinking of priestcraft, not philosophy, Cazotte,&rdquo; said
      Champfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Champfort, one of those men of letters who, though misled by the first
      fair show of the Revolution, refused to follow the baser men of action
      into its horrible excesses, lived to express the murderous philanthropy of
      its agents by the best bon mot of the time. Seeing written on the walls,
      &ldquo;Fraternite ou la Mort,&rdquo; he observed that the sentiment should be
      translated thus, &ldquo;Sois mon frere, ou je te tue.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Be my brother, or I
      kill thee.&rdquo;)) &ldquo;And what of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will open your own veins to escape the fraternity of Cain. Be
      comforted; the last drops will not follow the razor. For you, venerable
      Malesherbes; for you, Aimar Nicolai; for you, learned Bailly,&mdash;I see
      them dress the scaffold! And all the while, O great philosophers, your
      murderers will have no word but philosophy on their lips!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hush was complete and universal when the pupil of Voltaire&mdash;the
      prince of the academic sceptics, hot La Harpe&mdash;cried with a sarcastic
      laugh, &ldquo;Do not flatter me, O prophet, by exemption from the fate of my
      companions. Shall <i>I</i> have no part to play in this drama of your
      fantasies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this question, Cazotte&rsquo;s countenance lost its unnatural expression of
      awe and sternness; the sardonic humour most common to it came back and
      played in his brightening eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, La Harpe, the most wonderful part of all! YOU will become&mdash;a
      Christian!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was too much for the audience that a moment before seemed grave and
      thoughtful, and they burst into an immoderate fit of laughter, while
      Cazotte, as if exhausted by his predictions, sank back in his chair, and
      breathed hard and heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Madame de G&mdash;, &ldquo;you who have predicted such grave things
      concerning us, must prophesy something also about yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A convulsive tremor shook the involuntary prophet,&mdash;it passed, and
      left his countenance elevated by an expression of resignation and calm.
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said he, after a long pause, &ldquo;during the siege of Jerusalem, we
      are told by its historian that a man, for seven successive days, went
      round the ramparts, exclaiming, &lsquo;Woe to thee, Jerusalem,&mdash;woe to
      myself!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Cazotte, well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And on the seventh day, while he thus spoke, a stone from the machines of
      the Romans dashed him into atoms!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words, Cazotte rose; and the guests, awed in spite of
      themselves, shortly afterwards broke up and retired.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Qui donc t&rsquo;a donne la mission s&rsquo;annoncer au peuple que la
     divinite n&rsquo;existe pas?  Quel avantage trouves-tu a persuader a
     l&rsquo;homme qu&rsquo;une force aveugle preside a ses destinees et frappe au
     hasard le crime et la vertu?&mdash;Robespierre, &ldquo;Discours,&rdquo; Mai 7,
     1794.

     (Who then invested you with the mission to announce to the people
     that there is no God?  What advantage find you in persuading man
     that nothing but blind force presides over his destinies, and
     strikes haphazard both crime and virtue?)
</pre>
    <p>
      It was some time before midnight when the stranger returned home. His
      apartments were situated in one of those vast abodes which may be called
      an epitome of Paris itself,&mdash;the cellars rented by mechanics,
      scarcely removed a step from paupers, often by outcasts and fugitives from
      the law, often by some daring writer, who, after scattering amongst the
      people doctrines the most subversive of order, or the most libellous on
      the characters of priest, minister, and king, retired amongst the rats, to
      escape the persecution that attends the virtuous; the ground-floor
      occupied by shops; the entresol by artists; the principal stories by
      nobles; and the garrets by journeymen or grisettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the stranger passed up the stairs, a young man of a form and
      countenance singularly unprepossessing emerged from a door in the
      entresol, and brushed beside him. His glance was furtive, sinister,
      savage, and yet timorous; the man&rsquo;s face was of an ashen paleness, and the
      features worked convulsively. The stranger paused, and observed him with
      thoughtful looks, as he hurried down the stairs. While he thus stood, he
      heard a groan from the room which the young man had just quitted; the
      latter had pulled to the door with hasty vehemence, but some fragment,
      probably of fuel, had prevented its closing, and it now stood slightly
      ajar; the stranger pushed it open and entered. He passed a small anteroom,
      meanly furnished, and stood in a bedchamber of meagre and sordid
      discomfort. Stretched on the bed, and writhing in pain, lay an old man; a
      single candle lit the room, and threw its feeble ray over the furrowed and
      death-like face of the sick person. No attendant was by; he seemed left
      alone, to breathe his last. &ldquo;Water,&rdquo; he moaned feebly,&mdash;&ldquo;water:&mdash;I
      parch,&mdash;I burn!&rdquo; The intruder approached the bed, bent over him, and
      took his hand. &ldquo;Oh, bless thee, Jean, bless thee!&rdquo; said the sufferer;
      &ldquo;hast thou brought back the physician already? Sir, I am poor, but I can
      pay you well. I would not die yet, for that young man&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo; And he sat
      upright in his bed, and fixed his dim eyes anxiously on his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are your symptoms, your disease?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire, fire, fire in the heart, the entrails: I burn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long is it since you have taken food?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Food! only this broth. There is the basin, all I have taken these six
      hours. I had scarce drunk it ere these pains began.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger looked at the basin; some portion of the contents was yet
      left there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who administered this to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Jean! Who else should? I have no servant,&mdash;none! I am poor,
      very poor, sir. But no! you physicians do not care for the poor. I AM
      RICH! can you cure me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if Heaven permit. Wait but a few moments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man was fast sinking under the rapid effects of poison. The
      stranger repaired to his own apartments, and returned in a few moments
      with some preparation that had the instant result of an antidote. The pain
      ceased, the blue and livid colour receded from the lips; the old man fell
      into a profound sleep. The stranger drew the curtains round the bed, took
      up the light, and inspected the apartment. The walls of both rooms were
      hung with drawings of masterly excellence. A portfolio was filled with
      sketches of equal skill,&mdash;but these last were mostly subjects that
      appalled the eye and revolted the taste: they displayed the human figure
      in every variety of suffering,&mdash;the rack, the wheel, the gibbet; all
      that cruelty has invented to sharpen the pangs of death seemed yet more
      dreadful from the passionate gusto and earnest force of the designer. And
      some of the countenances of those thus delineated were sufficiently
      removed from the ideal to show that they were portraits; in a large, bold,
      irregular hand was written beneath these drawings, &ldquo;The Future of the
      Aristocrats.&rdquo; In a corner of the room, and close by an old bureau, was a
      small bundle, over which, as if to hide it, a cloak was thrown carelessly.
      Several shelves were filled with books; these were almost entirely the
      works of the philosophers of the time,&mdash;the philosophers of the
      material school, especially the Encyclopedistes, whom Robespierre
      afterwards so singularly attacked when the coward deemed it unsafe to
      leave his reign without a God.
    </p>
    <p>
      (&ldquo;Cette secte (les Encyclopedistes) propagea avec beaucoup de zele
      l&rsquo;opinion du materialisme, qui prevalut parmi les grands et parmi les
      beaux esprits; on lui doit en partie cette espece de philosophie pratique
      qui, reduisant l&rsquo;Egoisme en systeme regarde la societe humaine comme une
      guerre de ruse, le succes comme la regle du juste et de l&rsquo;injuste, la
      probite comme une affaire de gout, ou de bienseance, le monde comme le
      patrimoine des fripons adroits.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Discours de Robespierre,&rdquo; Mai 7,
      1794. (This sect (the Encyclopaedists) propagate with much zeal the
      doctrine of materialism, which prevails among the great and the wits; we
      owe to it partly that kind of practical philosophy which, reducing Egotism
      to a system, looks upon society as a war of cunning; success the rule of
      right and wrong, honesty as an affair of taste or decency: and the world
      as the patrimony of clever scoundrels.))
    </p>
    <p>
      A volume lay on a table,&mdash;it was one of Voltaire, and the page was
      opened at his argumentative assertion of the existence of the Supreme
      Being. (&ldquo;Histoire de Jenni.&rdquo;) The margin was covered with pencilled notes,
      in the stiff but tremulous hand of old age; all in attempt to refute or to
      ridicule the logic of the sage of Ferney: Voltaire did not go far enough
      for the annotator! The clock struck two, when the sound of steps was heard
      without. The stranger silently seated himself on the farther side of the
      bed, and its drapery screened him, as he sat, from the eyes of a man who
      now entered on tiptoe; it was the same person who had passed him on the
      stairs. The new-comer took up the candle and approached the bed. The old
      man&rsquo;s face was turned to the pillow; but he lay so still, and his
      breathing was so inaudible, that his sleep might well, by that hasty,
      shrinking, guilty glance, be mistaken for the repose of death. The
      new-comer drew back, and a grim smile passed over his face: he replaced
      the candle on the table, opened the bureau with a key which he took from
      his pocket, and loaded himself with several rouleaus of gold that he found
      in the drawers. At this time the old man began to wake. He stirred, he
      looked up; he turned his eyes towards the light now waning in its socket;
      he saw the robber at his work; he sat erect for an instant, as if
      transfixed, more even by astonishment than terror. At last he sprang from
      his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just Heaven! do I dream! Thou&mdash;thou&mdash;thou, for whom I toiled
      and starved!&mdash;THOU!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The robber started; the gold fell from his hand, and rolled on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;art thou not dead yet? Has the poison failed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poison, boy! Ah!&rdquo; shrieked the old man, and covered his face with his
      hands; then, with sudden energy, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Jean! Jean! recall that
      word. Rob, plunder me if thou wilt, but do not say thou couldst murder one
      who only lived for thee! There, there, take the gold; I hoarded it but for
      thee. Go! go!&rdquo; and the old man, who in his passion had quitted his bed,
      fell at the feet of the foiled assassin, and writhed on the ground,&mdash;the
      mental agony more intolerable than that of the body, which he had so
      lately undergone. The robber looked at him with a hard disdain. &ldquo;What have
      I ever done to thee, wretch?&rdquo; cried the old man,&mdash;&ldquo;what but loved and
      cherished thee? Thou wert an orphan,&mdash;an outcast. I nurtured, nursed,
      adopted thee as my son. If men call me a miser, it was but that none might
      despise thee, my heir, because Nature has stunted and deformed thee, when
      I was no more. Thou wouldst have had all when I was dead. Couldst thou not
      spare me a few months or days,&mdash;nothing to thy youth, all that is
      left to my age? What have I done to thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hast continued to live, and thou wouldst make no will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;TON DIEU! Thy God! Fool! Hast thou not told me, from my childhood, that
      there is NO God? Hast thou not fed me on philosophy? Hast thou not said,
      &lsquo;Be virtuous, be good, be just, for the sake of mankind: but there is no
      life after this life&rsquo;? Mankind! why should I love mankind? Hideous and
      misshapen, mankind jeer at me as I pass the streets. What hast thou done
      to me? Thou hast taken away from me, who am the scoff of this world, the
      hopes of another! Is there no other life? Well, then, I want thy gold,
      that at least I may hasten to make the best of this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monster! Curses light on thy ingratitude, thy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who hears thy curses? Thou knowest there is no God! Mark me; I have
      prepared all to fly. See,&mdash;I have my passport; my horses wait
      without; relays are ordered. I have thy gold.&rdquo; (And the wretch, as he
      spoke, continued coldly to load his person with the rouleaus). &ldquo;And now,
      if I spare thy life, how shall I be sure that thou wilt not inform against
      mine?&rdquo; He advanced with a gloomy scowl and a menacing gesture as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s anger changed to fear. He cowered before the savage. &ldquo;Let me
      live! let me live!&mdash;that&mdash;that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may pardon thee! Yes, thou hast nothing to fear from me. I swear it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swear! But by whom and what, old man? I cannot believe thee, if thou
      believest not in any God! Ha, ha! behold the result of thy lessons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another moment and those murderous fingers would have strangled their
      prey. But between the assassin and his victim rose a form that seemed
      almost to both a visitor from the world that both denied,&mdash;stately
      with majestic strength, glorious with awful beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ruffian recoiled, looked, trembled, and then turned and fled from the
      chamber. The old man fell again to the ground insensible.

      CHAPTER 1.VIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     To know how a bad man will act when in power, reverse all the
     doctrines he preaches when obscure.&mdash;S. Montague.

     Antipathies also form a part of magic (falsely) so-called.  Man
     naturally has the same instinct as the animals, which warns them
     involuntarily against the creatures that are hostile or fatal to
     their existence.  But HE so often neglects it, that it becomes

     &mdash;Trismegistus the Fourth (a Rosicrucian).
</pre>
    <p>
      When he again saw the old man the next day, the stranger found him calm,
      and surprisingly recovered from the scene and sufferings of the night. He
      expressed his gratitude to his preserver with tearful fervour, and stated
      that he had already sent for a relation who would make arrangements for
      his future safety and mode of life. &ldquo;For I have money yet left,&rdquo; said the
      old man; &ldquo;and henceforth have no motive to be a miser.&rdquo; He proceeded then
      briefly to relate the origin and circumstances of his connection with his
      intended murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems that in earlier life he had quarrelled with his relations,&mdash;from
      a difference in opinions of belief. Rejecting all religion as a fable, he
      yet cultivated feelings that inclined him&mdash;for though his intellect
      was weak, his dispositions were good&mdash;to that false and exaggerated
      sensibility which its dupes so often mistake for benevolence. He had no
      children; he resolved to adopt an enfant du peuple. He resolved to educate
      this boy according to &ldquo;reason.&rdquo; He selected an orphan of the lowest
      extraction, whose defects of person and constitution only yet the more
      moved his pity, and finally engrossed his affection. In this outcast he
      not only loved a son, he loved a theory! He brought him up most
      philosophically. Helvetius had proved to him that education can do all;
      and before he was eight years old, the little Jean&rsquo;s favourite expressions
      were, &ldquo;La lumiere et la vertu.&rdquo; (Light and virtue.) The boy showed
      talents, especially in art.
    </p>
    <p>
      The protector sought for a master who was as free from &ldquo;superstition&rdquo; as
      himself, and selected the painter David. That person, as hideous as his
      pupil, and whose dispositions were as vicious as his professional
      abilities were undeniable, was certainly as free from &ldquo;superstition&rdquo; as
      the protector could desire. It was reserved for Robespierre hereafter to
      make the sanguinary painter believe in the Etre Supreme. The boy was early
      sensible of his ugliness, which was almost preternatural. His benefactor
      found it in vain to reconcile him to the malice of Nature by his
      philosophical aphorisms; but when he pointed out to him that in this world
      money, like charity, covers a multitude of defects, the boy listened
      eagerly and was consoled. To save money for his protege,&mdash;for the
      only thing in the world he loved,&mdash;this became the patron&rsquo;s passion.
      Verily, he had met with his reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am thankful he has escaped,&rdquo; said the old man, wiping his eyes.
      &ldquo;Had he left me a beggar, I could never have accused him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, for you are the author of his crimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How! I, who never ceased to inculcate the beauty of virtue? Explain
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! if thy pupil did not make this clear to thee last night from his
      own lips, an angel might come from heaven to preach to thee in vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man moved uneasily, and was about to reply, when the relative he
      had sent for&mdash;and who, a native of Nancy, happened to be at Paris at
      the time&mdash;entered the room. He was a man somewhat past thirty, and of
      a dry, saturnine, meagre countenance, restless eyes, and compressed lips.
      He listened, with many ejaculations of horror, to his relation&rsquo;s recital,
      and sought earnestly, but in vain, to induce him to give information
      against his protege.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tush, tush, Rene Dumas!&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;you are a lawyer. You are
      bred to regard human life with contempt. Let any man break a law, and you
      shout, &lsquo;Execute him!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; cried Dumas, lifting up his hands and eyes: &ldquo;venerable sage, how you
      misjudge me! I lament more than any one the severity of our code. I think
      the state never should take away life,&mdash;no, not even the life of a
      murderer. I agree with that young statesman,&mdash;Maximilien Robespierre,&mdash;that
      the executioner is the invention of the tyrant. My very attachment to our
      advancing revolution is, that it must sweep away this legal butchery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer paused, out of breath. The stranger regarded him fixedly and
      turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You change countenance, sir,&rdquo; said Dumas; &ldquo;you do not agree with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, I was at that moment repressing a vague fear which seemed
      prophetic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that we should meet again, when your opinions on Death and the
      philosophy of Revolutions might be different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You enchant me, Cousin Rene,&rdquo; said the old man, who had listened to his
      relation with delight. &ldquo;Ah, I see you have proper sentiments of justice
      and philanthropy. Why did I not seek to know you before? You admire the
      Revolution;&mdash;you, equally with me, detest the barbarity of kings and
      the fraud of priests?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Detest! How could I love mankind if I did not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said the old man, hesitatingly, &ldquo;you do not think, with this noble
      gentleman, that I erred in the precepts I instilled into that wretched
      man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Erred! Was Socrates to blame if Alcibiades was an adulterer and a
      traitor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear him, you hear him! But Socrates had also a Plato; henceforth you
      shall be a Plato to me. You hear him?&rdquo; exclaimed the old man, turning to
      the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the latter was at the threshold. Who shall argue with the most
      stubborn of all bigotries,&mdash;the fanaticism of unbelief?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going?&rdquo; exclaimed Dumas, &ldquo;and before I have thanked you, blessed
      you, for the life of this dear and venerable man? Oh, if ever I can repay
      you,&mdash;if ever you want the heart&rsquo;s blood of Rene Dumas!&rdquo; Thus volubly
      delivering himself, he followed the stranger to the threshold of the
      second chamber, and there, gently detaining him, and after looking over
      his shoulder, to be sure that he was not heard by the owner, he whispered,
      &ldquo;I ought to return to Nancy. One would not lose one&rsquo;s time,&mdash;you
      don&rsquo;t think, sir, that that scoundrel took away ALL the old fool&rsquo;s money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it thus Plato spoke of Socrates, Monsieur Dumas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha!&mdash;you are caustic. Well, you have a right. Sir, we shall meet
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;AGAIN!&rdquo; muttered the stranger, and his brow darkened. He hastened to his
      chamber; he passed the day and the night alone, and in studies, no matter
      of what nature,&mdash;they served to increase his gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could ever connect his fate with Rene Dumas, or the fugitive
      assassin? Why did the buoyant air of Paris seem to him heavy with the
      steams of blood; why did an instinct urge him to fly from those sparkling
      circles, from that focus of the world&rsquo;s awakened hopes, warning him from
      return?&mdash;he, whose lofty existence defied&mdash;but away these dreams
      and omens! He leaves France behind. Back, O Italy, to thy majestic wrecks!
      On the Alps his soul breathes the free air once more. Free air! Alas! let
      the world-healers exhaust their chemistry; man never shall be as free in
      the marketplace as on the mountain. But we, reader, we too escape from
      these scenes of false wisdom clothing godless crime. Away, once more
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In den heitern Regionen Wo die reinen Formen wohnen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Away, to the loftier realm where the pure dwellers are. Unpolluted by the
      Actual, the Ideal lives only with Art and Beauty. Sweet Viola, by the
      shores of the blue Parthenope, by Virgil&rsquo;s tomb, and the Cimmerian cavern,
      we return to thee once more.

     Che non vuol che &lsquo;l destrier piu vada in alto,
     Poi lo lega nel margine marino
     A un verde mirto in mezzo un lauro E UN PINO.
     &ldquo;Orlando Furioso,&rdquo; c. vi. xxiii.

     (As he did not wish that his charger (the hippogriff) should take
     any further excursions into the higher regions for the present,
     he bound him at the sea-shore to a green myrtle between a laurel
     and a pine.)
</pre>
    <p>
      O Musician! art thou happy now? Thou art reinstalled at thy stately desk,&mdash;thy
      faithful barbiton has its share in the triumph. It is thy masterpiece
      which fills thy ear; it is thy daughter who fills the scene,&mdash;the
      music, the actress, so united, that applause to one is applause to both.
      They make way for thee, at the orchestra,&mdash;they no longer jeer and
      wink, when, with a fierce fondness, thou dost caress thy Familiar, that
      plains, and wails, and chides, and growls, under thy remorseless hand.
      They understand now how irregular is ever the symmetry of real genius. The
      inequalities in its surface make the moon luminous to man. Giovanni
      Paisiello, Maestro di Capella, if thy gentle soul could know envy, thou
      must sicken to see thy Elfrida and thy Pirro laid aside, and all Naples
      turned fanatic to the Siren, at whose measures shook querulously thy
      gentle head! But thou, Paisiello, calm in the long prosperity of fame,
      knowest that the New will have its day, and comfortest thyself that the
      Elfrida and the Pirro will live forever. Perhaps a mistake, but it is by
      such mistakes that true genius conquers envy. &ldquo;To be immortal,&rdquo; says
      Schiller, &ldquo;live in the whole.&rdquo; To be superior to the hour, live in thy
      self-esteem. The audience now would give their ears for those variations
      and flights they were once wont to hiss. No!&mdash;Pisani has been
      two-thirds of a life at silent work on his masterpiece: there is nothing
      he can add to THAT, however he might have sought to improve on the
      masterpieces of others. Is not this common? The least little critic, in
      reviewing some work of art, will say, &ldquo;pity this, and pity that;&rdquo; &ldquo;this
      should have been altered,&mdash;that omitted.&rdquo; Yea, with his wiry
      fiddlestring will he creak out his accursed variations. But let him sit
      down and compose himself. He sees no improvement in variations THEN! Every
      man can control his fiddle when it is his own work with which its vagaries
      would play the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Viola is the idol, the theme of Naples. She is the spoiled sultana of
      the boards. To spoil her acting may be easy enough,&mdash;shall they spoil
      her nature? No, I think not. There, at home, she is still good and simple;
      and there, under the awning by the doorway,&mdash;there she still sits,
      divinely musing. How often, crook-trunked tree, she looks to thy green
      boughs; how often, like thee, in her dreams, and fancies, does she
      struggle for the light,&mdash;not the light of the stage-lamps. Pooh,
      child! be contented with the lamps, even with the rush-lights. A farthing
      candle is more convenient for household purposes than the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weeks passed, and the stranger did not reappear; months had passed, and
      his prophecy of sorrow was not yet fulfilled. One evening Pisani was taken
      ill. His success had brought on the long-neglected composer pressing
      applications for concerti and sonata, adapted to his more peculiar science
      on the violin. He had been employed for some weeks, day and night, on a
      piece in which he hoped to excel himself. He took, as usual, one of those
      seemingly impracticable subjects which it was his pride to subject to the
      expressive powers of his art,&mdash;the terrible legend connected with the
      transformation of Philomel. The pantomime of sound opened with the gay
      merriment of a feast. The monarch of Thrace is at his banquet; a sudden
      discord brays through the joyous notes,&mdash;the string seems to screech
      with horror. The king learns the murder of his son by the hands of the
      avenging sisters. Swift rage the chords, through the passions of fear, of
      horror, of fury, and dismay. The father pursues the sisters. Hark! what
      changes the dread&mdash;the discord&mdash;into that long, silvery,
      mournful music? The transformation is completed; and Philomel, now the
      nightingale, pours from the myrtle-bough the full, liquid, subduing notes
      that are to tell evermore to the world the history of her woes and wrongs.
      Now, it was in the midst of this complicated and difficult attempt that
      the health of the over-tasked musician, excited alike by past triumph and
      new ambition, suddenly gave way. He was taken ill at night. The next
      morning the doctor pronounced that his disease was a malignant and
      infectious fever. His wife and Viola shared in their tender watch; but
      soon that task was left to the last alone. The Signora Pisani caught the
      infection, and in a few hours was even in a state more alarming than that
      of her husband. The Neapolitans, in common with the inhabitants of all
      warm climates, are apt to become selfish and brutal in their dread of
      infectious disorders. Gionetta herself pretended to be ill, to avoid the
      sick-chamber. The whole labour of love and sorrow fell on Viola. It was a
      terrible trial,&mdash;I am willing to hurry over the details. The wife
      died first!
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, a little before sunset, Pisani woke partially recovered from the
      delirium which had preyed upon him, with few intervals, since the second
      day of the disease; and casting about him his dizzy and feeble eyes, he
      recognised Viola, and smiled. He faltered her name as he rose and
      stretched his arms. She fell upon his breast, and strove to suppress her
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy mother?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Does she sleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She sleeps,&mdash;ah, yes!&rdquo; and the tears gushed forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought&mdash;eh! I know not WHAT I have thought. But do not weep: I
      shall be well now,&mdash;quite well. She will come to me when she wakes,&mdash;will
      she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Viola could not speak; but she busied herself in pouring forth an anodyne,
      which she had been directed to give the sufferer as soon as the delirium
      should cease. The doctor had told her, too, to send for him the instant so
      important a change should occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to the door and called to the woman who, during Gionetta&rsquo;s
      pretended illness, had been induced to supply her place; but the hireling
      answered not. She flew through the chambers to search for her in vain,&mdash;the
      hireling had caught Gionetta&rsquo;s fears, and vanished. What was to be done?
      The case was urgent,&mdash;the doctor had declared not a moment should be
      lost in obtaining his attendance; she must leave her father,&mdash;she
      must go herself! She crept back into the room,&mdash;the anodyne seemed
      already to have taken benign effect; the patient&rsquo;s eyes were closed, and
      he breathed regularly, as in sleep. She stole away, threw her veil over
      her face, and hurried from the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the anodyne had not produced the effect which it appeared to have
      done; instead of healthful sleep, it had brought on a kind of light-headed
      somnolence, in which the mind, preternaturally restless, wandered about
      its accustomed haunts, waking up its old familiar instincts and
      inclinations. It was not sleep,&mdash;it was not delirium; it was the
      dream-wakefulness which opium sometimes induces, when every nerve grows
      tremulously alive, and creates a corresponding activity in the frame, to
      which it gives a false and hectic vigour. Pisani missed something,&mdash;what,
      he scarcely knew; it was a combination of the two wants most essential to
      his mental life,&mdash;the voice of his wife, the touch of his Familiar.
      He rose,&mdash;he left his bed, he leisurely put on his old dressing-robe,
      in which he had been wont to compose. He smiled complacently as the
      associations connected with the garment came over his memory; he walked
      tremulously across the room, and entered the small cabinet next to his
      chamber, in which his wife had been accustomed more often to watch than
      sleep, when illness separated her from his side. The room was desolate and
      void. He looked round wistfully, and muttered to himself, and then
      proceeded regularly, and with a noiseless step, through the chambers of
      the silent house, one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came at last to that in which old Gionetta&mdash;faithful to her own
      safety, if nothing else&mdash;nursed herself, in the remotest corner of
      the house, from the danger of infection. As he glided in,&mdash;wan,
      emaciated, with an uneasy, anxious, searching look in his haggard eyes,&mdash;the
      old woman shrieked aloud, and fell at his feet. He bent over her, passed
      his thin hands along her averted face, shook his head, and said in a
      hollow voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot find them; where are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, dear master? Oh, have compassion on yourself; they are not here.
      Blessed saints! this is terrible; he has touched me; I am dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead! who is dead? Is any one dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! don&rsquo;t talk so; you must know it well: my poor mistress,&mdash;she
      caught the fever from you; it is infectious enough to kill a whole city.
      San Gennaro protect me! My poor mistress, she is dead,&mdash;buried, too;
      and I, your faithful Gionetta, woe is me! Go, go&mdash;to&mdash;to bed
      again, dearest master,&mdash;go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor musician stood for one moment mute and unmoving, then a slight
      shiver ran through his frame; he turned and glided back, silent and
      spectre-like, as he had entered. He came into the room where he had been
      accustomed to compose,&mdash;where his wife, in her sweet patience, had so
      often sat by his side, and praised and flattered when the world had but
      jeered and scorned. In one corner he found the laurel-wreath she had
      placed on his brows that happy night of fame and triumph; and near it,
      half hid by her mantilla, lay in its case the neglected instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viola was not long gone: she had found the physician; she returned with
      him; and as they gained the threshold, they heard a strain of music from
      within,&mdash;a strain of piercing, heart-rending anguish. It was not like
      some senseless instrument, mechanical in its obedience to a human hand,&mdash;it
      was as some spirit calling, in wail and agony from the forlorn shades, to
      the angels it beheld afar beyond the Eternal Gulf. They exchanged glances
      of dismay. They hurried into the house; they hastened into the room.
      Pisani turned, and his look, full of ghastly intelligence and stern
      command, awed them back. The black mantilla, the faded laurel-leaf, lay
      there before him. Viola&rsquo;s heart guessed all at a single glance; she sprung
      to his knees; she clasped them,&mdash;&ldquo;Father, father, <i>I</i> am left
      thee still!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wail ceased,&mdash;the note changed; with a confused association&mdash;half
      of the man, half of the artist&mdash;the anguish, still a melody, was
      connected with sweeter sounds and thoughts. The nightingale had escaped
      the pursuit,&mdash;soft, airy, bird-like, thrilled the delicious notes a
      moment, and then died away. The instrument fell to the floor, and its
      chords snapped. You heard that sound through the silence. The artist
      looked on his kneeling child, and then on the broken chords... &ldquo;Bury me by
      her side,&rdquo; he said, in a very calm, low voice; &ldquo;and THAT by mine.&rdquo; And
      with these words his whole frame became rigid, as if turned to stone. The
      last change passed over his face. He fell to the ground, sudden and heavy.
      The chords THERE, too,&mdash;the chords of the human instrument were
      snapped asunder. As he fell, his robe brushed the laurel-wreath, and that
      fell also, near but not in reach of the dead man&rsquo;s nerveless hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Broken instrument, broken heart, withered laurel-wreath!&mdash;the setting
      sun through the vine-clad lattice streamed on all! So smiles the eternal
      Nature on the wrecks of all that make life glorious! And not a sun that
      sets not somewhere on the silenced music,&mdash;on the faded laurel!

    <p>
      And they buried the musician and his barbiton together, in the same
      coffin. That famous Steiner&mdash;primeval Titan of the great Tyrolese
      race&mdash;often hast thou sought to scale the heavens, and therefore must
      thou, like the meaner children of men, descend to the dismal Hades! Harder
      fate for thee than thy mortal master. For THY soul sleeps with thee in the
      coffin. And the music that belongs to HIS, separate from the instrument,
      ascends on high, to be heard often by a daughter&rsquo;s pious ears when the
      heaven is serene and the earth sad. For there is a sense of hearing that
      the vulgar know not. And the voices of the dead breathe soft and frequent
      to those who can unite the memory with the faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Viola is alone in the world,&mdash;alone in the home where
      loneliness had seemed from the cradle a thing that was not of nature. And
      at first the solitude and the stillness were insupportable. Have you, ye
      mourners, to whom these sibyl leaves, weird with many a dark enigma, shall
      be borne, have you not felt that when the death of some best-loved one has
      made the hearth desolate,&mdash;have you not felt as if the gloom of the
      altered home was too heavy for thought to bear?&mdash;you would leave it,
      though a palace, even for a cabin. And yet,&mdash;sad to say,&mdash;when
      you obey the impulse, when you fly from the walls, when in the strange
      place in which you seek your refuge nothing speaks to you of the lost,
      have ye not felt again a yearning for that very food to memory which was
      just before but bitterness and gall? Is it not almost impious and profane
      to abandon that dear hearth to strangers? And the desertion of the home
      where your parents dwelt, and blessed you, upbraids your conscience as if
      you had sold their tombs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beautiful was the Etruscan superstition that the ancestors become the
      household gods. Deaf is the heart to which the Lares call from the
      desolate floors in vain. At first Viola had, in her intolerable anguish,
      gratefully welcomed the refuge which the house and family of a kindly
      neighbour, much attached to her father, and who was one of the orchestra
      that Pisani shall perplex no more, had proffered to the orphan. But the
      company of the unfamiliar in our grief, the consolation of the stranger,
      how it irritates the wound! And then, to hear elsewhere the name of
      father, mother, child,&mdash;as if death came alone to you,&mdash;to see
      elsewhere the calm regularity of those lives united in love and order,
      keeping account of happy hours, the unbroken timepiece of home, as if
      nowhere else the wheels were arrested, the chain shattered, the hands
      motionless, the chime still! No, the grave itself does not remind us of
      our loss like the company of those who have no loss to mourn. Go back to
      thy solitude, young orphan,&mdash;go back to thy home: the sorrow that
      meets thee on the threshold can greet thee, even in its sadness, like the
      smile upon the face of the dead. And there, from thy casement, and there,
      from without thy door, thou seest still the tree, solitary as thyself, and
      springing from the clefts of the rock, but forcing its way to light,&mdash;as,
      through all sorrow, while the seasons yet can renew the verdure and bloom
      of youth, strives the instinct of the human heart! Only when the sap is
      dried up, only when age comes on, does the sun shine in vain for man and
      for the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weeks and months&mdash;months sad and many&mdash;again passed, and Naples
      will not longer suffer its idol to seclude itself from homage. The world
      ever plucks us back from ourselves with a thousand arms. And again Viola&rsquo;s
      voice is heard upon the stage, which, mystically faithful to life, is in
      nought more faithful than this, that it is the appearances that fill the
      scene; and we pause not to ask of what realities they are the proxies.
      When the actor of Athens moved all hearts as he clasped the burial urn,
      and burst into broken sobs; how few, there, knew that it held the ashes of
      his son! Gold, as well as fame, was showered upon the young actress; but
      she still kept to her simple mode of life, to her lowly home, to the one
      servant whose faults, selfish as they were, Viola was too inexperienced to
      perceive. And it was Gionetta who had placed her when first born in her
      father&rsquo;s arms! She was surrounded by every snare, wooed by every
      solicitation that could beset her unguarded beauty and her dangerous
      calling. But her modest virtue passed unsullied through them all. It is
      true that she had been taught by lips now mute the maiden duties enjoined
      by honour and religion. And all love that spoke not of the altar only
      shocked and repelled her. But besides that, as grief and solitude ripened
      her heart, and made her tremble at times to think how deeply it could
      feel, her vague and early visions shaped themselves into an ideal of love.
      And till the ideal is found, how the shadow that it throws before it
      chills us to the actual! With that ideal, ever and ever, unconsciously,
      and with a certain awe and shrinking, came the shape and voice of the
      warning stranger. Nearly two years had passed since he had appeared at
      Naples. Nothing had been heard of him, save that his vessel had been
      directed, some months after his departure, to sail for Leghorn. By the
      gossips of Naples, his existence, supposed so extraordinary, was wellnigh
      forgotten; but the heart of Viola was more faithful. Often he glided
      through her dreams, and when the wind sighed through that fantastic tree,
      associated with his remembrance, she started with a tremor and a blush, as
      if she had heard him speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      But amongst the train of her suitors was one to whom she listened more
      gently than to the rest; partly because, perhaps, he spoke in her mother&rsquo;s
      native tongue; partly because in his diffidence there was little to alarm
      and displease; partly because his rank, nearer to her own than that of
      lordlier wooers, prevented his admiration from appearing insult; partly
      because he himself, eloquent and a dreamer, often uttered thoughts that
      were kindred to those buried deepest in her mind. She began to like,
      perhaps to love him, but as a sister loves; a sort of privileged
      familiarity sprung up between them. If in the Englishman&rsquo;s breast arose
      wild and unworthy hopes, he had not yet expressed them. Is there danger to
      thee here, lone Viola, or is the danger greater in thy unfound ideal?
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, as the overture to some strange and wizard spectacle, closes this
      opening prelude. Wilt thou hear more? Come with thy faith prepared. I ask
      not the blinded eyes, but the awakened sense. As the enchanted Isle,
      remote from the homes of men,&mdash;

    <p>
      One moonlit night, in the Gardens at Naples, some four or five gentleman
      were seated under a tree, drinking their sherbet, and listening, in the
      intervals of conversation, to the music which enlivened that gay and
      favourite resort of an indolent population. One of this little party was a
      young Englishman, who had been the life of the whole group, but who, for
      the last few moments, had sunk into a gloomy and abstracted reverie. One
      of his countrymen observed this sudden gloom, and, tapping him on the
      back, said, &ldquo;What ails you, Glyndon? Are you ill? You have grown quite
      pale,&mdash;you tremble. Is it a sudden chill? You had better go home:
      these Italian nights are often dangerous to our English constitutions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am well now; it was a passing shudder. I cannot account for it
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A man, apparently of about thirty years of age, and of a mien and
      countenance strikingly superior to those around him, turned abruptly, and
      looked steadfastly at Glyndon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I understand what you mean,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and perhaps,&rdquo; he added,
      with a grave smile, &ldquo;I could explain it better than yourself.&rdquo; Here,
      turning to the others, he added, &ldquo;You must often have felt, gentlemen,
      each and all of you, especially when sitting alone at night, a strange and
      unaccountable sensation of coldness and awe creep over you; your blood
      curdles, and the heart stands still; the limbs shiver; the hair bristles;
      you are afraid to look up, to turn your eyes to the darker corners of the
      room; you have a horrible fancy that something unearthly is at hand;
      presently the whole spell, if I may so call it, passes away, and you are
      ready to laugh at your own weakness. Have you not often felt what I have
      thus imperfectly described?&mdash;if so, you can understand what our young
      friend has just experienced, even amidst the delights of this magical
      scene, and amidst the balmy whispers of a July night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Glyndon, evidently much surprised, &ldquo;you have defined
      exactly the nature of that shudder which came over me. But how could my
      manner be so faithful an index to my impressions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the signs of the visitation,&rdquo; returned the stranger, gravely;
      &ldquo;they are not to be mistaken by one of my experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the gentleman present then declared that they could comprehend, and
      had felt, what the stranger had described.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;According to one of our national superstitions,&rdquo; said Mervale, the
      Englishman who had first addressed Glyndon, &ldquo;the moment you so feel your
      blood creep, and your hair stand on end, some one is walking over the spot
      which shall be your grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are in all lands different superstitions to account for so common
      an occurrence,&rdquo; replied the stranger: &ldquo;one sect among the Arabians holds
      that at that instant God is deciding the hour either of your death, or of
      some one dear to you. The African savage, whose imagination is darkened by
      the hideous rites of his gloomy idolatry, believes that the Evil Spirit is
      pulling you towards him by the hair: so do the Grotesque and the Terrible
      mingle with each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is evidently a mere physical accident,&mdash;a derangement of the
      stomach, a chill of the blood,&rdquo; said a young Neapolitan, with whom Glyndon
      had formed a slight acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why is it always coupled in all nations with some superstitious
      presentiment or terror,&mdash;some connection between the material frame
      and the supposed world without us? For my part, I think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, what do you think, sir?&rdquo; asked Glyndon, curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; continued the stranger, &ldquo;that it is the repugnance and horror
      with which our more human elements recoil from something, indeed,
      invisible, but antipathetic to our own nature; and from a knowledge of
      which we are happily secured by the imperfection of our senses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a believer in spirits, then?&rdquo; said Mervale, with an incredulous
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, it was not precisely of spirits that I spoke; but there may be forms
      of matter as invisible and impalpable to us as the animalculae in the air
      we breathe,&mdash;in the water that plays in yonder basin. Such beings may
      have passions and powers like our own&mdash;as the animalculae to which I
      have compared them. The monster that lives and dies in a drop of water&mdash;carnivorous,
      insatiable, subsisting on the creatures minuter than himself&mdash;is not
      less deadly in his wrath, less ferocious in his nature, than the tiger of
      the desert. There may be things around us that would be dangerous and
      hostile to men, if Providence had not placed a wall between them and us,
      merely by different modifications of matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And think you that wall never can be removed?&rdquo; asked young Glyndon,
      abruptly. &ldquo;Are the traditions of sorcerer and wizard, universal and
      immemorial as they are, merely fables?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps yes,&mdash;perhaps no,&rdquo; answered the stranger, indifferently.
      &ldquo;But who, in an age in which the reason has chosen its proper bounds,
      would be mad enough to break the partition that divides him from the boa
      and the lion,&mdash;to repine at and rebel against the law which confines
      the shark to the great deep? Enough of these idle speculations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the stranger rose, summoned the attendant, paid for his sherbet, and,
      bowing slightly to the company, soon disappeared among the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that gentleman?&rdquo; asked Glyndon, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest looked at each other, without replying, for some moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw him before,&rdquo; said Mervale, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know him well,&rdquo; said the Neapolitan, who was, indeed, the Count Cetoxa.
      &ldquo;If you remember, it was as my companion that he joined you. He visited
      Naples about two years ago, and has recently returned; he is very rich,&mdash;indeed,
      enormously so. A most agreeable person. I am sorry to hear him talk so
      strangely to-night; it serves to encourage the various foolish reports
      that are circulated concerning him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And surely,&rdquo; said another Neapolitan, &ldquo;the circumstance that occurred but
      the other day, so well known to yourself, Cetoxa, justifies the reports
      you pretend to deprecate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Myself and my countryman,&rdquo; said Glyndon, &ldquo;mix so little in Neapolitan
      society, that we lose much that appears well worthy of lively interest.
      May I enquire what are the reports, and what is the circumstance you refer
      to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to the reports, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Cetoxa, courteously, addressing
      himself to the two Englishmen, &ldquo;it may suffice to observe, that they
      attribute to the Signor Zanoni certain qualities which everybody desires
      for himself, but damns any one else for possessing. The incident Signor
      Belgioso alludes to, illustrates these qualities, and is, I must own,
      somewhat startling. You probably play, gentlemen?&rdquo; (Here Cetoxa paused;
      and as both Englishmen had occasionally staked a few scudi at the public
      gaming-tables, they bowed assent to the conjecture.) Cetoxa continued.
      &ldquo;Well, then, not many days since, and on the very day that Zanoni returned
      to Naples, it so happened that I had been playing pretty high, and had
      lost considerably. I rose from the table, resolved no longer to tempt
      fortune, when I suddenly perceived Zanoni, whose acquaintance I had before
      made (and who, I may say, was under some slight obligation to me),
      standing by, a spectator. Ere I could express my gratification at this
      unexpected recognition, he laid his hand on my arm. &lsquo;You have lost much,&rsquo; 
      said he; &lsquo;more than you can afford. For my part, I dislike play; yet I
      wish to have some interest in what is going on. Will you play this sum for
      me? the risk is mine,&mdash;the half profits yours.&rsquo; I was startled, as
      you may suppose, at such an address; but Zanoni had an air and tone with
      him it was impossible to resist; besides, I was burning to recover my
      losses, and should not have risen had I had any money left about me. I
      told him I would accept his offer, provided we shared the risk as well as
      profits. &lsquo;As you will,&rsquo; said he, smiling; &lsquo;we need have no scruple, for
      you will be sure to win.&rsquo; I sat down; Zanoni stood behind me; my luck
      rose,&mdash;I invariably won. In fact, I rose from the table a rich man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can be no foul play at the public tables, especially when foul play
      would make against the bank?&rdquo; This question was put by Glyndon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied the count. &ldquo;But our good fortune was, indeed,
      marvellous,&mdash;so extraordinary that a Sicilian (the Sicilians are all
      ill-bred, bad-tempered fellows) grew angry and insolent. &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said he,
      turning to my new friend, &lsquo;you have no business to stand so near to the
      table. I do not understand this; you have not acted fairly.&rsquo; Zanoni
      replied, with great composure, that he had done nothing against the rules,&mdash;that
      he was very sorry that one man could not win without another man losing;
      and that he could not act unfairly, even if disposed to do so. The
      Sicilian took the stranger&rsquo;s mildness for apprehension, and blustered more
      loudly. In fact, he rose from the table, and confronted Zanoni in a manner
      that, to say the least of it, was provoking to any gentleman who has some
      quickness of temper, or some skill with the small-sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; interrupted Belgioso, &ldquo;the most singular part of the whole to me
      was, that this Zanoni, who stood opposite to where I sat, and whose face I
      distinctly saw, made no remark, showed no resentment. He fixed his eyes
      steadfastly on the Sicilian; never shall I forget that look! it is
      impossible to describe it,&mdash;it froze the blood in my veins. The
      Sicilian staggered back as if struck. I saw him tremble; he sank on the
      bench. And then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, then,&rdquo; said Cetoxa, &ldquo;to my infinite surprise, our gentleman, thus
      disarmed by a look from Zanoni, turned his whole anger upon me, THE&mdash;but
      perhaps you do not know, gentlemen, that I have some repute with my
      weapon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best swordsman in Italy,&rdquo; said Belgioso.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I could guess why or wherefore,&rdquo; resumed Cetoxa, &ldquo;I found myself
      in the garden behind the house, with Ughelli (that was the Sicilian&rsquo;s
      name) facing me, and five or six gentlemen, the witnesses of the duel
      about to take place, around. Zanoni beckoned me aside. &lsquo;This man will
      fall,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;When he is on the ground, go to him, and ask whether he
      will be buried by the side of his father in the church of San Gennaro?&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Do you then know his family?&rsquo; I asked with great surprise. Zanoni made me
      no answer, and the next moment I was engaged with the Sicilian. To do him
      justice, his imbrogliato was magnificent, and a swifter lounger never
      crossed a sword; nevertheless,&rdquo; added Cetoxa, with a pleasing modesty, &ldquo;he
      was run through the body. I went up to him; he could scarcely speak. &lsquo;Have
      you any request to make,&mdash;any affairs to settle?&rsquo; He shook his head.
      &lsquo;Where would you wish to be interred?&rsquo; He pointed towards the Sicilian
      coast. &lsquo;What!&rsquo; said I, in surprise, &lsquo;NOT by the side of your father, in
      the church of San Gennaro?&rsquo; As I spoke, his face altered terribly; he
      uttered a piercing shriek,&mdash;the blood gushed from his mouth, and he
      fell dead. The most strange part of the story is to come. We buried him in
      the church of San Gennaro. In doing so, we took up his father&rsquo;s coffin;
      the lid came off in moving it, and the skeleton was visible. In the hollow
      of the skull we found a very slender wire of sharp steel; this caused
      surprise and inquiry. The father, who was rich and a miser, had died
      suddenly, and been buried in haste, owing, it was said, to the heat of the
      weather. Suspicion once awakened, the examination became minute. The old
      man&rsquo;s servant was questioned, and at last confessed that the son had
      murdered the sire. The contrivance was ingenious: the wire was so slender
      that it pierced to the brain, and drew but one drop of blood, which the
      grey hairs concealed. The accomplice will be executed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Zanoni,&mdash;did he give evidence, did he account for&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; interrupted the count: &ldquo;he declared that he had by accident visited
      the church that morning; that he had observed the tombstone of the Count
      Ughelli; that his guide had told him the count&rsquo;s son was in Naples,&mdash;a
      spendthrift and a gambler. While we were at play, he had heard the count
      mentioned by name at the table; and when the challenge was given and
      accepted, it had occurred to him to name the place of burial, by an
      instinct which he either could not or would not account for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very lame story,&rdquo; said Mervale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! but we Italians are superstitious,&mdash;the alleged instinct was
      regarded by many as the whisper of Providence. The next day the stranger
      became an object of universal interest and curiosity. His wealth, his
      manner of living, his extraordinary personal beauty, have assisted also to
      make him the rage; besides, I have had the pleasure in introducing so
      eminent a person to our gayest cavaliers and our fairest ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most interesting narrative,&rdquo; said Mervale, rising. &ldquo;Come, Glyndon;
      shall we seek our hotel? It is almost daylight. Adieu, signor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What think you of this story?&rdquo; said Glyndon, as the young men walked
      homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it is very clear that this Zanoni is some imposter,&mdash;some
      clever rogue; and the Neapolitan shares the booty, and puffs him off with
      all the hackneyed charlatanism of the marvellous. An unknown adventurer
      gets into society by being made an object of awe and curiosity; he is more
      than ordinarily handsome, and the women are quite content to receive him
      without any other recommendation than his own face and Cetoxa&rsquo;s fables.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot agree with you. Cetoxa, though a gambler and a rake, is a
      nobleman of birth and high repute for courage and honour. Besides, this
      stranger, with his noble presence and lofty air,&mdash;so calm, so
      unobtrusive,&mdash;has nothing in common with the forward garrulity of an
      imposter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Glyndon, pardon me; but you have not yet acquired any knowledge
      of the world! The stranger makes the best of a fine person, and his grand
      air is but a trick of the trade. But to change the subject,&mdash;how
      advances the love affair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Viola could not see me to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not marry her. What would they all say at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us enjoy the present,&rdquo; said Glyndon, with vivacity; &ldquo;we are young,
      rich, good-looking; let us not think of to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, Glyndon! Here we are at the hotel. Sleep sound, and don&rsquo;t dream of
      Signor Zanoni.&rdquo;

    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

     &ldquo;Ger. Lib.,&rdquo; c. vi. xxix.

    <p>
      Clarence Glyndon was a young man of fortune, not large, but easy and
      independent. His parents were dead, and his nearest relation was an only
      sister, left in England under the care of her aunt, and many years younger
      than himself. Early in life he had evinced considerable promise in the art
      of painting, and rather from enthusiasm than any pecuniary necessity for a
      profession, he determined to devote himself to a career in which the
      English artist generally commences with rapture and historical
      composition, to conclude with avaricious calculation and portraits of
      Alderman Simpkins. Glyndon was supposed by his friends to possess no
      inconsiderable genius; but it was of a rash and presumptuous order. He was
      averse from continuous and steady labour, and his ambition rather sought
      to gather the fruit than to plant the tree. In common with many artists in
      their youth, he was fond of pleasure and excitement, yielding with little
      forethought to whatever impressed his fancy or appealed to his passions.
      He had travelled through the more celebrated cities of Europe, with the
      avowed purpose and sincere resolution of studying the divine masterpieces
      of his art. But in each, pleasure had too often allured him from ambition,
      and living beauty distracted his worship from the senseless canvas. Brave,
      adventurous, vain, restless, inquisitive, he was ever involved in wild
      projects and pleasant dangers,&mdash;the creature of impulse and the slave
      of imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then the period when a feverish spirit of change was working its
      way to that hideous mockery of human aspirations, the Revolution of
      France; and from the chaos into which were already jarring the sanctities
      of the World&rsquo;s Venerable Belief, arose many shapeless and unformed
      chimeras. Need I remind the reader that, while that was the day for
      polished scepticism and affected wisdom, it was the day also for the most
      egregious credulity and the most mystical superstitions,&mdash;the day in
      which magnetism and magic found converts amongst the disciples of Diderot;
      when prophecies were current in every mouth; when the salon of a
      philosophical deist was converted into an Heraclea, in which necromancy
      professed to conjure up the shadows of the dead; when the Crosier and the
      Book were ridiculed, and Mesmer and Cagliostro were believed. In that
      Heliacal Rising, heralding the new sun before which all vapours were to
      vanish, stalked from their graves in the feudal ages all the phantoms that
      had flitted before the eyes of Paracelsus and Agrippa. Dazzled by the dawn
      of the Revolution, Glyndon was yet more attracted by its strange
      accompaniments; and natural it was with him, as with others, that the
      fancy which ran riot amidst the hopes of a social Utopia, should grasp
      with avidity all that promised, out of the dusty tracks of the beaten
      science, the bold discoveries of some marvellous Elysium.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his travels he had listened with vivid interest, at least, if not with
      implicit belief, to the wonders told of each more renowned Ghost-seer, and
      his mind was therefore prepared for the impression which the mysterious
      Zanoni at first sight had produced upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There might be another cause for this disposition to credulity. A remote
      ancestor of Glyndon&rsquo;s on the mother&rsquo;s side, had achieved no inconsiderable
      reputation as a philosopher and alchemist. Strange stories were afloat
      concerning this wise progenitor. He was said to have lived to an age far
      exceeding the allotted boundaries of mortal existence, and to have
      preserved to the last the appearance of middle life. He had died at
      length, it was supposed, of grief for the sudden death of a
      great-grandchild, the only creature he had ever appeared to love. The
      works of this philosopher, though rare, were extant, and found in the
      library of Glyndon&rsquo;s home. Their Platonic mysticism, their bold
      assertions, the high promises that might be detected through their
      figurative and typical phraseology, had early made a deep impression on
      the young imagination of Clarence Glyndon. His parents, not alive to the
      consequences of encouraging fancies which the very enlightenment of the
      age appeared to them sufficient to prevent or dispel, were fond, in the
      long winter nights, of conversing on the traditional history of this
      distinguished progenitor. And Clarence thrilled with a fearful pleasure
      when his mother playfully detected a striking likeness between the
      features of the young heir and the faded portrait of the alchemist that
      overhung their mantelpiece, and was the boast of their household and the
      admiration of their friends,&mdash;the child is, indeed, more often than
      we think for, &ldquo;the father of the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have said that Glyndon was fond of pleasure. Facile, as genius ever must
      be, to cheerful impression, his careless artist-life, ere artist-life
      settles down to labour, had wandered from flower to flower. He had
      enjoyed, almost to the reaction of satiety, the gay revelries of Naples,
      when he fell in love with the face and voice of Viola Pisani. But his
      love, like his ambition, was vague and desultory. It did not satisfy his
      whole heart and fill up his whole nature; not from want of strong and
      noble passions, but because his mind was not yet matured and settled
      enough for their development. As there is one season for the blossom,
      another for the fruit; so it is not till the bloom of fancy begins to
      fade, that the heart ripens to the passions that the bloom precedes and
      foretells. Joyous alike at his lonely easel or amidst his boon companions,
      he had not yet known enough of sorrow to love deeply. For man must be
      disappointed with the lesser things of life before he can comprehend the
      full value of the greatest. It is the shallow sensualists of France, who,
      in their salon-language, call love &ldquo;a folly,&rdquo;&mdash;love, better
      understood, is wisdom. Besides, the world was too much with Clarence
      Glyndon. His ambition of art was associated with the applause and
      estimation of that miserable minority of the surface that we call the
      Public.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like those who deceive, he was ever fearful of being himself the dupe. He
      distrusted the sweet innocence of Viola. He could not venture the hazard
      of seriously proposing marriage to an Italian actress; but the modest
      dignity of the girl, and something good and generous in his own nature,
      had hitherto made him shrink from any more worldly but less honourable
      designs. Thus the familiarity between them seemed rather that of kindness
      and regard than passion. He attended the theatre; he stole behind the
      scenes to converse with her; he filled his portfolio with countless
      sketches of a beauty that charmed him as an artist as well as lover; and
      day after day he floated on through a changing sea of doubt and
      irresolution, of affection and distrust. The last, indeed, constantly
      sustained against his better reason by the sober admonitions of Mervale, a
      matter-of-fact man!
    </p>
    <p>
      The day following that eve on which this section of my story opens,
      Glyndon was riding alone by the shores of the Neapolitan sea, on the other
      side of the Cavern of Posilipo. It was past noon; the sun had lost its
      early fervour, and a cool breeze sprung up voluptuously from the sparkling
      sea. Bending over a fragment of stone near the roadside, he perceived the
      form of a man; and when he approached, he recognised Zanoni.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman saluted him courteously. &ldquo;Have you discovered some
      antique?&rdquo; said he, with a smile; &ldquo;they are common as pebbles on this
      road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Zanoni; &ldquo;it was but one of those antiques that have their
      date, indeed, from the beginning of the world, but which Nature eternally
      withers and renews.&rdquo; So saying, he showed Glyndon a small herb with a
      pale-blue flower, and then placed it carefully in his bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an herbalist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, I am told, a study full of interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To those who understand it, doubtless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the knowledge, then, so rare?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rare! The deeper knowledge is perhaps rather, among the arts, LOST to the
      modern philosophy of commonplace and surface! Do you imagine there was no
      foundation for those traditions which come dimly down from remoter ages,&mdash;as
      shells now found on the mountain-tops inform us where the seas have been?
      What was the old Colchian magic, but the minute study of Nature in her
      lowliest works? What the fable of Medea, but a proof of the powers that
      may be extracted from the germ and leaf? The most gifted of all the
      Priestcrafts, the mysterious sisterhoods of Cuth, concerning whose
      incantations Learning vainly bewilders itself amidst the maze of legends,
      sought in the meanest herbs what, perhaps, the Babylonian Sages explored
      in vain amidst the loftiest stars. Tradition yet tells you that there
      existed a race (&ldquo;Plut. Symp.&rdquo; l. 5. c. 7.) who could slay their enemies
      from afar, without weapon, without movement. The herb that ye tread on may
      have deadlier powers than your engineers can give to their mightiest
      instruments of war. Can you guess that to these Italian shores, to the old
      Circaean Promontory, came the Wise from the farthest East, to search for
      plants and simples which your Pharmacists of the Counter would fling from
      them as weeds? The first herbalists&mdash;the master chemists of the world&mdash;were
      the tribe that the ancient reverence called by the name of Titans.
      (Syncellus, page 14.&mdash;&ldquo;Chemistry the Invention of the Giants.&rdquo;) I
      remember once, by the Hebrus, in the reign of &mdash; But this talk,&rdquo; said
      Zanoni, checking himself abruptly, and with a cold smile, &ldquo;serves only to
      waste your time and my own.&rdquo; He paused, looked steadily at Glyndon, and
      continued, &ldquo;Young man, think you that vague curiosity will supply the
      place of earnest labour? I read your heart. You wish to know me, and not
      this humble herb: but pass on; your desire cannot be satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not the politeness of your countrymen,&rdquo; said Glyndon, somewhat
      discomposed. &ldquo;Suppose I were desirous to cultivate your acquaintance, why
      should you reject my advances?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reject no man&rsquo;s advances,&rdquo; answered Zanoni; &ldquo;I must know them if they
      so desire; but ME, in return, they can never comprehend. If you ask my
      acquaintance, it is yours; but I would warn you to shun me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why are you, then, so dangerous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On this earth, men are often, without their own agency, fated to be
      dangerous to others. If I were to predict your fortune by the vain
      calculations of the astrologer, I should tell you, in their despicable
      jargon, that my planet sat darkly in your house of life. Cross me not, if
      you can avoid it. I warn you now for the first time and last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You despise the astrologers, yet you utter a jargon as mysterious as
      theirs. I neither gamble nor quarrel; why, then, should I fear you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you will; I have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me speak frankly,&mdash;your conversation last night interested and
      perplexed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it: minds like yours are attracted by mystery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon was piqued at these words, though in the tone in which they were
      spoken there was no contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you do not consider me worthy of your friendship. Be it so.
      Good-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanoni coldly replied to the salutation; and as the Englishman rode on,
      returned to his botanical employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same night, Glyndon went, as usual, to the theatre. He was standing
      behind the scenes watching Viola, who was on the stage in one of her most
      brilliant parts. The house resounded with applause. Glyndon was
      transported with a young man&rsquo;s passion and a young man&rsquo;s pride: &ldquo;This
      glorious creature,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;may yet be mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt, while thus wrapped in delicious reverie, a slight touch upon his
      shoulder; he turned, and beheld Zanoni. &ldquo;You are in danger,&rdquo; said the
      latter. &ldquo;Do not walk home to-night; or if you do, go not alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Glyndon recovered from his surprise, Zanoni disappeared; and when
      the Englishman saw him again, he was in the box of one of the Neapolitan
      nobles, where Glyndon could not follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viola now left the stage, and Glyndon accosted her with an unaccustomed
      warmth of gallantry. But Viola, contrary to her gentle habit, turned with
      an evident impatience from the address of her lover. Taking aside
      Gionetta, who was her constant attendant at the theatre, she said, in an
      earnest whisper,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Gionetta! He is here again!&mdash;the stranger of whom I spoke to
      thee!&mdash;and again, he alone, of the whole theatre, withholds from me
      his applause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is he, my darling?&rdquo; said the old woman, with fondness in her voice.
      &ldquo;He must indeed be dull&mdash;not worth a thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The actress drew Gionetta nearer to the stage, and pointed out to her a
      man in one of the boxes, conspicuous amongst all else by the simplicity of
      his dress, and the extraordinary beauty of his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not worth a thought, Gionetta!&rdquo; repeated Viola,&mdash;&ldquo;Not worth a
      thought! Alas, not to think of him, seems the absence of thought itself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prompter summoned the Signora Pisani. &ldquo;Find out his name, Gionetta,&rdquo;
       said she, moving slowly to the stage, and passing by Glyndon, who gazed at
      her with a look of sorrowful reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene on which the actress now entered was that of the final
      catastrophe, wherein all her remarkable powers of voice and art were
      pre-eminently called forth. The house hung on every word with breathless
      worship; but the eyes of Viola sought only those of one calm and unmoved
      spectator; she exerted herself as if inspired. Zanoni listened, and
      observed her with an attentive gaze, but no approval escaped his lips; no
      emotion changed the expression of his cold and half-disdainful aspect.
      Viola, who was in the character of one who loved, but without return,
      never felt so acutely the part she played. Her tears were truthful; her
      passion that of nature: it was almost too terrible to behold. She was
      borne from the stage exhausted and insensible, amidst such a tempest of
      admiring rapture as Continental audiences alone can raise. The crowd stood
      up, handkerchiefs waved, garlands and flowers were thrown on the stage,&mdash;men
      wiped their eyes, and women sobbed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By heavens!&rdquo; said a Neapolitan of great rank, &ldquo;She has fired me beyond
      endurance. To-night&mdash;this very night&mdash;she shall be mine! You
      have arranged all, Mascari?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All, signor. And the young Englishman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The presuming barbarian! As I before told thee, let him bleed for his
      folly. I will have no rival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But an Englishman! There is always a search after the bodies of the
      English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool! is not the sea deep enough, or the earth secret enough, to hide one
      dead man? Our ruffians are silent as the grave itself; and I!&mdash;who
      would dare to suspect, to arraign the Prince di &mdash;? See to it,&mdash;this
      night. I trust him to you. Robbers murder him, you understand,&mdash;the
      country swarms with them; plunder and strip him, the better to favour such
      report. Take three men; the rest shall be my escort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mascari shrugged his shoulders, and bowed submissively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The streets of Naples were not then so safe as now, and carriages were
      both less expensive and more necessary. The vehicle which was regularly
      engaged by the young actress was not to be found. Gionetta, too aware of
      the beauty of her mistress and the number of her admirers to contemplate
      without alarm the idea of their return on foot, communicated her distress
      to Glyndon, and he besought Viola, who recovered but slowly, to accept his
      own carriage. Perhaps before that night she would not have rejected so
      slight a service. Now, for some reason or other, she refused. Glyndon,
      offended, was retiring sullenly, when Gionetta stopped him. &ldquo;Stay,
      signor,&rdquo; said she, coaxingly: &ldquo;the dear signora is not well,&mdash;do not
      be angry with her; I will make her accept your offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon stayed, and after a few moments spent in expostulation on the part
      of Gionetta, and resistance on that of Viola, the offer was accepted.
      Gionetta and her charge entered the carriage, and Glyndon was left at the
      door of the theatre to return home on foot. The mysterious warning of
      Zanoni then suddenly occurred to him; he had forgotten it in the interest
      of his lover&rsquo;s quarrel with Viola. He thought it now advisable to guard
      against danger foretold by lips so mysterious. He looked round for some
      one he knew: the theatre was disgorging its crowds; they hustled, and
      jostled, and pressed upon him; but he recognised no familiar countenance.
      While pausing irresolute, he heard Mervale&rsquo;s voice calling on him, and, to
      his great relief, discovered his friend making his way through the throng.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have secured you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a place in the Count Cetoxa&rsquo;s carriage.
      Come along, he is waiting for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How kind in you! how did you find me out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met Zanoni in the passage,&mdash;&lsquo;Your friend is at the door of
      the theatre,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;do not let him go home on foot to-night; the
      streets of Naples are not always safe.&rsquo; I immediately remembered that some
      of the Calabrian bravos had been busy within the city the last few weeks,
      and suddenly meeting Cetoxa&mdash;but here he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Further explanation was forbidden, for they now joined the count. As
      Glyndon entered the carriage and drew up the glass, he saw four men
      standing apart by the pavement, who seemed to eye him with attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cospetto!&rdquo; cried one; &ldquo;that is the Englishman!&rdquo; Glyndon imperfectly heard
      the exclamation as the carriage drove on. He reached home in safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The familiar and endearing intimacy which always exists in Italy between
      the nurse and the child she has reared, and which the &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo;
       of Shakespeare in no way exaggerates, could not but be drawn yet closer
      than usual, in a situation so friendless as that of the orphan-actress. In
      all that concerned the weaknesses of the heart, Gionetta had large
      experience; and when, three nights before, Viola, on returning from the
      theatre, had wept bitterly, the nurse had succeeded in extracting from her
      a confession that she had seen one,&mdash;not seen for two weary and
      eventful years,&mdash;but never forgotten, and who, alas! had not evinced
      the slightest recognition of herself. Gionetta could not comprehend all
      the vague and innocent emotions that swelled this sorrow; but she resolved
      them all, with her plain, blunt understanding, to the one sentiment of
      love. And here, she was well fitted to sympathise and console. Confidante
      to Viola&rsquo;s entire and deep heart she never could be,&mdash;for that heart
      never could have words for all its secrets. But such confidence as she
      could obtain, she was ready to repay by the most unreproving pity and the
      most ready service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you discovered who he is?&rdquo; asked Viola, as she was now alone in the
      carriage with Gionetta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he is the celebrated Signor Zanoni, about whom all the great ladies
      have gone mad. They say he is so rich!&mdash;oh! so much richer than any
      of the Inglesi!&mdash;not but what the Signor Glyndon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cease!&rdquo; interrupted the young actress. &ldquo;Zanoni! Speak of the Englishman
      no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carriage was now entering that more lonely and remote part of the city
      in which Viola&rsquo;s house was situated, when it suddenly stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gionetta, in alarm, thrust her head out of the window, and perceived, by
      the pale light of the moon, that the driver, torn from his seat, was
      already pinioned in the arms of two men; the next moment the door was
      opened violently, and a tall figure, masked and mantled, appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear not, fairest Pisani,&rdquo; said he, gently; &ldquo;no ill shall befall you.&rdquo; As
      he spoke, he wound his arm round the form of the fair actress, and
      endeavoured to lift her from the carriage. But Gionetta was no ordinary
      ally,&mdash;she thrust back the assailant with a force that astonished
      him, and followed the shock by a volley of the most energetic reprobation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mask drew back, and composed his disordered mantle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the body of Bacchus!&rdquo; said he, half laughing, &ldquo;she is well protected.
      Here, Luigi, Giovanni! seize the hag!&mdash;quick!&mdash;why loiter ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mask retired from the door, and another and yet taller form presented
      itself. &ldquo;Be calm, Viola Pisani,&rdquo; said he, in a low voice; &ldquo;with me you are
      indeed safe!&rdquo; He lifted his mask as he spoke, and showed the noble
      features of Zanoni.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be calm, be hushed,&mdash;I can save you.&rdquo; He vanished, leaving Viola
      lost in surprise, agitation, and delight. There were, in all, nine masks:
      two were engaged with the driver; one stood at the head of the
      carriage-horses; a fourth guarded the well-trained steeds of the party;
      three others (besides Zanoni and the one who had first accosted Viola)
      stood apart by a carriage drawn to the side of the road. To these three
      Zanoni motioned; they advanced; he pointed towards the first mask, who was
      in fact the Prince di &mdash;, and to his unspeakable astonishment the
      prince was suddenly seized from behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Treason!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Treason among my own men! What means this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Place him in his carriage! If he resist, his blood be on his own head!&rdquo;
       said Zanoni, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He approached the men who had detained the coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are outnumbered and outwitted,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;join your lord; you are
      three men,&mdash;we six, armed to the teeth. Thank our mercy that we spare
      your lives. Go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men gave way, dismayed. The driver remounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut the traces of their carriage and the bridles of their horses,&rdquo; said
      Zanoni, as he entered the vehicle containing Viola, which now drove on
      rapidly, leaving the discomfited ravisher in a state of rage and stupor
      impossible to describe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to explain this mystery to you,&rdquo; said Zanoni. &ldquo;I discovered the
      plot against you,&mdash;no matter how; I frustrated it thus: The head of
      this design is a nobleman, who has long persecuted you in vain. He and two
      of his creatures watched you from the entrance of the theatre, having
      directed six others to await him on the spot where you were attacked;
      myself and five of my servants supplied their place, and were mistaken for
      his own followers. I had previously ridden alone to the spot where the men
      were waiting, and informed them that their master would not require their
      services that night. They believed me, and accordingly dispersed. I then
      joined my own band, whom I had left in the rear; you know all. We are at
      your door.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER 2.III.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,
     For all the day they view things unrespected;
     But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,
     And, darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.
     Shakespeare.

     Zanoni followed the young Neapolitan into her house; Gionetta
     vanished,&mdash;they were left alone.
</pre>
    <p>
      Alone, in that room so often filled, in the old happy days, with the wild
      melodies of Pisani; and now, as she saw this mysterious, haunting, yet
      beautiful and stately stranger, standing on the very spot where she had
      sat at her father&rsquo;s feet, thrilled and spellbound,&mdash;she almost
      thought, in her fantastic way of personifying her own airy notions, that
      that spiritual Music had taken shape and life, and stood before her
      glorious in the image it assumed. She was unconscious all the while of her
      own loveliness. She had thrown aside her hood and veil; her hair, somewhat
      disordered, fell over the ivory neck which the dress partially displayed;
      and as her dark eyes swam with grateful tears, and her cheek flushed with
      its late excitement, the god of light and music himself never, amidst his
      Arcadian valleys, wooed, in his mortal guise, maiden or nymph more fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zanoni gazed at her with a look in which admiration seemed not unmingled
      with compassion. He muttered a few words to himself, and then addressed
      her aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Viola, I have saved you from a great peril; not from dishonour only, but
      perhaps from death. The Prince di &mdash;, under a weak despot and a venal
      administration, is a man above the law. He is capable of every crime; but
      amongst his passions he has such prudence as belongs to ambition; if you
      were not to reconcile yourself to your shame, you would never enter the
      world again to tell your tale. The ravisher has no heart for repentance,
      but he has a hand that can murder. I have saved you, Viola. Perhaps you
      would ask me wherefore?&rdquo; Zanoni paused, and smiled mournfully, as he
      added, &ldquo;You will not wrong me by the thought that he who has preserved is
      not less selfish than he who would have injured. Orphan, I do not speak to
      you in the language of your wooers; enough that I know pity, and am not
      ungrateful for affection. Why blush, why tremble at the word? I read your
      heart while I speak, and I see not one thought that should give you shame.
      I say not that you love me yet; happily, the fancy may be roused long
      before the heart is touched. But it has been my fate to fascinate your
      eye, to influence your imagination. It is to warn you against what could
      bring you but sorrow, as I warned you once to prepare for sorrow itself,
      that I am now your guest. The Englishman, Glyndon, loves thee well,&mdash;better,
      perhaps, than I can ever love; if not worthy of thee, yet, he has but to
      know thee more to deserve thee better. He may wed thee, he may bear thee
      to his own free and happy land,&mdash;the land of thy mother&rsquo;s kin. Forget
      me; teach thyself to return and deserve his love; and I tell thee that
      thou wilt be honoured and be happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Viola listened with silent, inexpressible emotion, and burning blushes, to
      this strange address, and when he had concluded, she covered her face with
      her hands, and wept. And yet, much as his words were calculated to humble
      or irritate, to produce indignation or excite shame, those were not the
      feelings with which her eyes streamed and her heart swelled. The woman at
      that moment was lost in the child; and AS a child, with all its exacting,
      craving, yet innocent desire to be loved, weeps in unrebuking sadness when
      its affection is thrown austerely back upon itself,&mdash;so, without
      anger and without shame, wept Viola.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zanoni contemplated her thus, as her graceful head, shadowed by its
      redundant tresses, bent before him; and after a moment&rsquo;s pause he drew
      near to her, and said, in a voice of the most soothing sweetness, and with
      a half smile upon his lip,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember, when I told you to struggle for the light, that I
      pointed for example to the resolute and earnest tree? I did not tell you,
      fair child, to take example by the moth, that would soar to the star, but
      falls scorched beside the lamp. Come, I will talk to thee. This Englishman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Viola drew herself away, and wept yet more passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Englishman is of thine own years, not far above thine own rank. Thou
      mayst share his thoughts in life,&mdash;thou mayst sleep beside him in the
      same grave in death! And I&mdash;but THAT view of the future should
      concern us not. Look into thy heart, and thou wilt see that till again my
      shadow crossed thy path, there had grown up for this thine equal a pure
      and calm affection that would have ripened into love. Hast thou never
      pictured to thyself a home in which thy partner was thy young wooer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said Viola, with sudden energy,&mdash;&ldquo;never but to feel that
      such was not the fate ordained me. And, oh!&rdquo; she continued, rising
      suddenly, and, putting aside the tresses that veiled her face, she fixed
      her eyes upon the questioner,&mdash;&ldquo;and, oh! whoever thou art that thus
      wouldst read my soul and shape my future, do not mistake the sentiment
      that, that&mdash;&rdquo; she faltered an instant, and went on with downcast
      eyes,&mdash;&ldquo;that has fascinated my thoughts to thee. Do not think that I
      could nourish a love unsought and unreturned. It is not love that I feel
      for thee, stranger. Why should I? Thou hast never spoken to me but to
      admonish,&mdash;and now, to wound!&rdquo; Again she paused, again her voice
      faltered; the tears trembled on her eyelids; she brushed them away and
      resumed. &ldquo;No, not love,&mdash;if that be love which I have heard and read
      of, and sought to simulate on the stage,&mdash;but a more solemn, fearful,
      and, it seems to me, almost preternatural attraction, which makes me
      associate thee, waking or dreaming, with images that at once charm and
      awe. Thinkest thou, if it were love, that I could speak to thee thus;
      that,&rdquo; she raised her looks suddenly to his, &ldquo;mine eyes could thus search
      and confront thine own? Stranger, I ask but at times to see, to hear thee!
      Stranger, talk not to me of others. Forewarn, rebuke, bruise my heart,
      reject the not unworthy gratitude it offers thee, if thou wilt, but come
      not always to me as an omen of grief and trouble. Sometimes have I seen
      thee in my dreams surrounded by shapes of glory and light; thy looks
      radiant with a celestial joy which they wear not now. Stranger, thou hast
      saved me, and I thank and bless thee! Is that also a homage thou wouldst
      reject?&rdquo; With these words, she crossed her arms meekly on her bosom, and
      inclined lowlily before him. Nor did her humility seem unwomanly or
      abject, nor that of mistress to lover, of slave to master, but rather of a
      child to its guardian, of a neophyte of the old religion to her priest.
      Zanoni&rsquo;s brow was melancholy and thoughtful. He looked at her with a
      strange expression of kindness, of sorrow, yet of tender affection, in his
      eyes; but his lips were stern, and his voice cold, as he replied,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what you ask, Viola? Do you guess the danger to yourself&mdash;perhaps
      to both of us&mdash;which you court? Do you know that my life, separated
      from the turbulent herd of men, is one worship of the Beautiful, from
      which I seek to banish what the Beautiful inspires in most? As a calamity,
      I shun what to man seems the fairest fate,&mdash;the love of the daughters
      of earth. At present I can warn and save thee from many evils; if I saw
      more of thee, would the power still be mine? You understand me not. What I
      am about to add, it will be easier to comprehend. I bid thee banish from
      thy heart all thought of me, but as one whom the Future cries aloud to
      thee to avoid. Glyndon, if thou acceptest his homage, will love thee till
      the tomb closes upon both. I, too,&rdquo; he added with emotion,&mdash;&ldquo;I, too,
      might love thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; cried Viola, with the vehemence of a sudden impulse of delight, of
      rapture, which she could not suppress; but the instant after, she would
      have given worlds to recall the exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Viola, I might love thee; but in that love what sorrow and what
      change! The flower gives perfume to the rock on whose heart it grows. A
      little while, and the flower is dead; but the rock still endures,&mdash;the
      snow at its breast, the sunshine on its summit. Pause,&mdash;think well.
      Danger besets thee yet. For some days thou shalt be safe from thy
      remorseless persecutor; but the hour soon comes when thy only security
      will be in flight. If the Englishman love thee worthily, thy honour will
      be dear to him as his own; if not, there are yet other lands where love
      will be truer, and virtue less in danger from fraud and force. Farewell;
      my own destiny I cannot foresee except through cloud and shadow. I know,
      at least, that we shall meet again; but learn ere then, sweet flower, that
      there are more genial resting-places than the rock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned as he spoke, and gained the outer door where Gionetta discreetly
      stood. Zanoni lightly laid his hand on her arm. With the gay accent of a
      jesting cavalier, he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Signor Glyndon woos your mistress; he may wed her. I know your love
      for her. Disabuse her of any caprice for me. I am a bird ever on the
      wing.&rdquo;

     Les Intelligences Celestes se font voir, et see communiquent plus
     volontiers, dans le silence et dans la tranquillite de la

     &ldquo;Les Clavicules de Rabbi Salomon,&rdquo; chapter 3; traduites

     (The Celestial Intelligences exhibit and explain themselves most
     freely in silence and the tranquillity of solitude.  One will
     have then a little chamber, or a secret cabinet, etc.)
</pre>
    <p>
      The palace retained by Zanoni was in one of the less frequented quarters
      of the city. It still stands, now ruined and dismantled, a monument of the
      splendour of a chivalry long since vanished from Naples, with the lordly
      races of the Norman and the Spaniard.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he entered the rooms reserved for his private hours, two Indians, in
      the dress of their country, received him at the threshold with the grave
      salutations of the East. They had accompanied him from the far lands in
      which, according to rumour, he had for many years fixed his home. But they
      could communicate nothing to gratify curiosity or justify suspicion. They
      spoke no language but their own. With the exception of these two his
      princely retinue was composed of the native hirelings of the city, whom
      his lavish but imperious generosity made the implicit creatures of his
      will. In his house, and in his habits, so far as they were seen, there was
      nothing to account for the rumours which were circulated abroad. He was
      not, as we are told of Albertus Magnus or the great Leonardo da Vinci,
      served by airy forms; and no brazen image, the invention of magic
      mechanism, communicated to him the influences of the stars. None of the
      apparatus of the alchemist&mdash;the crucible and the metals&mdash;gave
      solemnity to his chambers, or accounted for his wealth; nor did he even
      seem to interest himself in those serener studies which might be supposed
      to colour his peculiar conversation with abstract notions, and often with
      recondite learning. No books spoke to him in his solitude; and if ever he
      had drawn from them his knowledge, it seemed now that the only page he
      read was the wide one of Nature, and that a capacious and startling memory
      supplied the rest. Yet was there one exception to what in all else seemed
      customary and commonplace, and which, according to the authority we have
      prefixed to this chapter, might indicate the follower of the occult
      sciences. Whether at Rome or Naples, or, in fact, wherever his abode, he
      selected one room remote from the rest of the house, which was fastened by
      a lock scarcely larger than the seal of a ring, yet which sufficed to
      baffle the most cunning instruments of the locksmith: at least, one of his
      servants, prompted by irresistible curiosity, had made the attempt in
      vain; and though he had fancied it was tried in the most favourable time
      for secrecy,&mdash;not a soul near, in the dead of night, Zanoni himself
      absent from home,&mdash;yet his superstition, or his conscience, told him
      the reason why the next day the Major Domo quietly dismissed him. He
      compensated himself for this misfortune by spreading his own story, with a
      thousand amusing exaggerations. He declared that, as he approached the
      door, invisible hands seemed to pluck him away; and that when he touched
      the lock, he was struck, as by a palsy, to the ground. One surgeon, who
      heard the tale, observed, to the distaste of the wonder-mongers, that
      possibly Zanoni made a dexterous use of electricity. Howbeit, this room,
      once so secured, was never entered save by Zanoni himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solemn voice of Time, from the neighbouring church at last aroused the
      lord of the palace from the deep and motionless reverie, rather resembling
      a trance than thought, in which his mind was absorbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is one more sand out of the mighty hour-glass,&rdquo; said he, murmuringly,
      &ldquo;and yet time neither adds to, nor steals from, an atom in the Infinite!
      Soul of mine, the luminous, the Augoeides (Augoeides,&mdash;a word
      favoured by the mystical Platonists, sphaira psuches augoeides, otan mete
      ekteinetai epi ti, mete eso suntreche mete sunizane, alla photi lampetai,
      o ten aletheian opa ten panton, kai ten en aute.&mdash;Marc. Ant., lib. 2.&mdash;The
      sense of which beautiful sentence of the old philosophy, which, as Bayle
      well observes, in his article on Cornelius Agrippa, the modern Quietists
      have (however impotently) sought to imitate, is to the effect that &lsquo;the
      sphere of the soul is luminous when nothing external has contact with the
      soul itself; but when lit by its own light, it sees the truth of all
      things and the truth centred in itself.&rsquo;), why descendest thou from thy
      sphere,&mdash;why from the eternal, starlike, and passionless Serene,
      shrinkest thou back to the mists of the dark sarcophagus? How long, too
      austerely taught that companionship with the things that die brings with
      it but sorrow in its sweetness, hast thou dwelt contented with thy
      majestic solitude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he thus murmured, one of the earliest birds that salute the dawn broke
      into sudden song from amidst the orange-trees in the garden below his
      casement; and as suddenly, song answered song; the mate, awakened at the
      note, gave back its happy answer to the bird. He listened; and not the
      soul he had questioned, but the heart replied. He rose, and with restless
      strides paced the narrow floor. &ldquo;Away from this world!&rdquo; he exclaimed at
      length, with an impatient tone. &ldquo;Can no time loosen its fatal ties? As the
      attraction that holds the earth in space, is the attraction that fixes the
      soul to earth. Away from the dark grey planet! Break, ye fetters: arise,
      ye wings!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He passed through the silent galleries, and up the lofty stairs, and
      entered the secret chamber....

      CHAPTER 2.V.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     I and my fellows
     Are ministers of Fate.
     &mdash;&ldquo;The Tempest.&rdquo;
  </pre>
    <p>
      The next day Glyndon bent his steps towards Zanoni&rsquo;s palace. The young
      man&rsquo;s imagination, naturally inflammable, was singularly excited by the
      little he had seen and heard of this strange being,&mdash;a spell, he
      could neither master nor account for, attracted him towards the stranger.
      Zanoni&rsquo;s power seemed mysterious and great, his motives kindly and
      benevolent, yet his manners chilling and repellent. Why at one moment
      reject Glyndon&rsquo;s acquaintance, at another save him from danger? How had
      Zanoni thus acquired the knowledge of enemies unknown to Glyndon himself?
      His interest was deeply roused, his gratitude appealed to; he resolved to
      make another effort to conciliate the ungracious herbalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The signor was at home, and Glyndon was admitted into a lofty saloon,
      where in a few moments Zanoni joined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am come to thank you for your warning last night,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and to
      entreat you to complete my obligation by informing me of the quarter to
      which I may look for enmity and peril.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a gallant,&rdquo; said Zanoni, with a smile, and in the English
      language, &ldquo;and do you know so little of the South as not to be aware that
      gallants have always rivals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; said Glyndon, colouring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most serious. You love Viola Pisani; you have for rival one of the most
      powerful and relentless of the Neapolitan princes. Your danger is indeed
      great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But pardon me!&mdash;how came it known to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give no account of myself to mortal man,&rdquo; replied Zanoni, haughtily;
      &ldquo;and to me it matters nothing whether you regard or scorn my warning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I may not question you, be it so; but at least advise me what to
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you follow my advice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you are constitutionally brave; you are fond of excitement and
      mystery; you like to be the hero of a romance. Were I to advise you to
      leave Naples, would you do so while Naples contains a foe to confront or a
      mistress to pursue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said the young Englishman, with energy. &ldquo;No! and you
      cannot reproach me for such a resolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is another course left to you: do you love Viola Pisani truly
      and fervently?&mdash;if so, marry her, and take a bride to your native
      land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; answered Glyndon, embarrassed; &ldquo;Viola is not of my rank. Her
      profession, too, is&mdash;in short, I am enslaved by her beauty, but I
      cannot wed her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanoni frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your love, then, is but selfish lust, and I advise you to your own
      happiness no more. Young man, Destiny is less inexorable than it appears.
      The resources of the great Ruler of the Universe are not so scanty and so
      stern as to deny to men the divine privilege of Free Will; all of us can
      carve out our own way, and God can make our very contradictions harmonise
      with His solemn ends. You have before you an option. Honourable and
      generous love may even now work out your happiness, and effect your
      escape; a frantic and selfish passion will but lead you to misery and
      doom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you pretend, then, to read the future?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have said all that it pleases me to utter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While you assume the moralist to me, Signor Zanoni,&rdquo; said Glyndon, with a
      smile, &ldquo;are you yourself so indifferent to youth and beauty as to act the
      stoic to its allurements?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were necessary that practice square with precept,&rdquo; said Zanoni,
      with a bitter smile, &ldquo;our monitors would be but few. The conduct of the
      individual can affect but a small circle beyond himself; the permanent
      good or evil that he works to others lies rather in the sentiments he can
      diffuse. His acts are limited and momentary; his sentiments may pervade
      the universe, and inspire generations till the day of doom. All our
      virtues, all our laws, are drawn from books and maxims, which ARE
      sentiments, not from deeds. In conduct, Julian had the virtues of a
      Christian, and Constantine the vices of a Pagan. The sentiments of Julian
      reconverted thousands to Paganism; those of Constantine helped, under
      Heaven&rsquo;s will, to bow to Christianity the nations of the earth. In
      conduct, the humblest fisherman on yonder sea, who believes in the
      miracles of San Gennaro, may be a better man than Luther; to the
      sentiments of Luther the mind of modern Europe is indebted for the noblest
      revolution it has known. Our opinions, young Englishman, are the angel
      part of us; our acts, the earthly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have reflected deeply for an Italian,&rdquo; said Glyndon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you that I was an Italian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not? And yet, when I hear you speak my own language as a native,
      I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tush!&rdquo; interrupted Zanoni, impatiently turning away. Then, after a pause,
      he resumed in a mild voice, &ldquo;Glyndon, do you renounce Viola Pisani? Will
      you take some days to consider what I have said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Renounce her,&mdash;never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will marry her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so; she will then renounce you. I tell you that you have rivals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; the Prince di &mdash;; but I do not fear him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have another whom you will fear more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon turned pale, and started from his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, Signor Zanoni!&mdash;you,&mdash;and you dare to tell me so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dare! Alas! there are times when I wish that I could fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These arrogant words were not uttered arrogantly, but in a tone of the
      most mournful dejection. Glyndon was enraged, confounded, and yet awed.
      However, he had a brave English heart within his breast, and he recovered
      himself quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signor,&rdquo; said he, calmly, &ldquo;I am not to be duped by these solemn phrases
      and these mystical assumptions. You may have powers which I cannot
      comprehend or emulate, or you may be but a keen imposter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, proceed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, then,&rdquo; continued Glyndon, resolutely, though somewhat
      disconcerted,&mdash;&ldquo;I mean you to understand, that, though I am not to be
      persuaded or compelled by a stranger to marry Viola Pisani, I am not the
      less determined never tamely to yield her to another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanoni looked gravely at the young man, whose sparkling eyes and
      heightened colour testified the spirit to support his words, and replied,
      &ldquo;So bold! well; it becomes you. But take my advice; wait yet nine days,
      and tell me then if you will marry the fairest and the purest creature
      that ever crossed your path.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you love her, why&mdash;why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why am I anxious that she should wed another?&mdash;to save her from
      myself! Listen to me. That girl, humble and uneducated though she be, has
      in her the seeds of the most lofty qualities and virtues. She can be all
      to the man she loves,&mdash;all that man can desire in wife. Her soul,
      developed by affection, will elevate your own; it will influence your
      fortunes, exalt your destiny; you will become a great and a prosperous
      man. If, on the contrary, she fall to me, I know not what may be her lot;
      but I know that there is an ordeal which few can pass, and which hitherto
      no woman has survived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Zanoni spoke, his face became colourless, and there was something in
      his voice that froze the warm blood of the listener.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this mystery which surrounds you?&rdquo; exclaimed Glyndon, unable to
      repress his emotion. &ldquo;Are you, in truth, different from other men? Have
      you passed the boundary of lawful knowledge? Are you, as some declare, a
      sorcerer, or only a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; interrupted Zanoni, gently, and with a smile of singular but
      melancholy sweetness; &ldquo;have you earned the right to ask me these
      questions? Though Italy still boast an Inquisition, its power is rivelled
      as a leaf which the first wind shall scatter. The days of torture and
      persecution are over; and a man may live as he pleases, and talk as it
      suits him, without fear of the stake and the rack. Since I can defy
      persecution, pardon me if I do not yield to curiosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon blushed, and rose. In spite of his love for Viola, and his natural
      terror of such a rival, he felt himself irresistibly drawn towards the
      very man he had most cause to suspect and dread. He held out his hand to
      Zanoni, saying, &ldquo;Well, then, if we are to be rivals, our swords must
      settle our rights; till then I would fain be friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends! You know not what you ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enigmas again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enigmas!&rdquo; cried Zanoni, passionately; &ldquo;ay! can you dare to solve them?
      Not till then could I give you my right hand, and call you friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could dare everything and all things for the attainment of superhuman
      wisdom,&rdquo; said Glyndon, and his countenance was lighted up with wild and
      intense enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zanoni observed him in thoughtful silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The seeds of the ancestor live in the son,&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;he may&mdash;yet&mdash;&rdquo;
       He broke off abruptly; then, speaking aloud, &ldquo;Go, Glyndon,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;we
      shall meet again, but I will not ask your answer till the hour presses for
      decision.&rdquo;

     &lsquo;Tis certain that this man has an estate of fifty thousand
     livres, and seems to be a person of very great accomplishments.
     But, then, if he&rsquo;s a wizard, are wizards so devoutly given as
     this man seems to be?  In short, I could make neither head nor
     tail on&rsquo;t

     &mdash;The Count de Gabalis, Translation affixed to the
     second edition of the &ldquo;Rape of the Lock.&rdquo;
  </pre>
    <p>
      Of all the weaknesses which little men rail against, there is none that
      they are more apt to ridicule than the tendency to believe. And of all the
      signs of a corrupt heart and a feeble head, the tendency of incredulity is
      the surest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Real philosophy seeks rather to solve than to deny. While we hear, every
      day, the small pretenders to science talk of the absurdities of alchemy
      and the dream of the Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone, a more erudite knowledge is
      aware that by alchemists the greatest discoveries in science have been
      made, and much which still seems abstruse, had we the key to the mystic
      phraseology they were compelled to adopt, might open the way to yet more
      noble acquisitions. The Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone itself has seemed no visionary
      chimera to some of the soundest chemists that even the present century has
      produced. (Mr. Disraeli, in his &ldquo;Curiosities of Literature&rdquo; (article
      &ldquo;Alchem&rdquo;), after quoting the sanguine judgments of modern chemists as to
      the transmutation of metals, observes of one yet greater and more recent
      than those to which Glyndon&rsquo;s thoughts could have referred, &ldquo;Sir Humphry
      Davy told me that he did not consider this undiscovered art as impossible;
      but should it ever be discovered, it would certainly be useless.&rdquo;) Man
      cannot contradict the Laws of Nature. But are all the laws of Nature yet
      discovered?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a proof of your art,&rdquo; says the rational inquirer. &ldquo;When I have
      seen the effect, I will endeavour, with you, to ascertain the causes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat to the above effect were the first thoughts of Clarence Glyndon
      on quitting Zanoni. But Clarence Glyndon was no &ldquo;rational inquirer.&rdquo; The
      more vague and mysterious the language of Zanoni, the more it imposed upon
      him. A proof would have been something tangible, with which he would have
      sought to grapple. And it would have only disappointed his curiosity to
      find the supernatural reduced to Nature. He endeavoured in vain, at some
      moments rousing himself from credulity to the scepticism he deprecated, to
      reconcile what he had heard with the probable motives and designs of an
      imposter. Unlike Mesmer and Cagliostro, Zanoni, whatever his pretensions,
      did not make them a source of profit; nor was Glyndon&rsquo;s position or rank
      in life sufficient to render any influence obtained over his mind,
      subservient to schemes, whether of avarice or ambition. Yet, ever and
      anon, with the suspicion of worldly knowledge, he strove to persuade
      himself that Zanoni had at least some sinister object in inducing him to
      what his English pride and manner of thought considered a derogatory
      marriage with the poor actress. Might not Viola and the Mystic be in
      league with each other? Might not all this jargon of prophecy and menace
      be but artifices to dupe him?
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt an unjust resentment towards Viola at having secured such an ally.
      But with that resentment was mingled a natural jealousy. Zanoni threatened
      him with rivalry. Zanoni, who, whatever his character or his arts,
      possessed at least all the external attributes that dazzle and command.
      Impatient of his own doubts, he plunged into the society of such
      acquaintances as he had made at Naples&mdash;chiefly artists, like
      himself, men of letters, and the rich commercialists, who were already
      vying with the splendour, though debarred from the privileges, of the
      nobles. From these he heard much of Zanoni, already with them, as with the
      idler classes, an object of curiosity and speculation.

      He had noticed, as a thing remarkable, that Zanoni had conversed with him
      in English, and with a command of the language so complete that he might
      have passed for a native. On the other hand, in Italian, Zanoni was
      equally at ease. Glyndon found that it was the same in languages less
      usually learned by foreigners. A painter from Sweden, who had conversed
      with him, was positive that he was a Swede; and a merchant from
      Constantinople, who had sold some of his goods to Zanoni, professed his
      conviction that none but a Turk, or at least a native of the East, could
      have so thoroughly mastered the soft Oriental intonations. Yet in all
      these languages, when they came to compare their several recollections,
      there was a slight, scarce perceptible distinction, not in pronunciation,
      nor even accent, but in the key and chime, as it were, of the voice,
      between himself and a native. This faculty was one which Glyndon called to
      mind, that sect, whose tenets and powers have never been more than most
      partially explored, the Rosicrucians, especially arrogated. He remembered
      to have heard in Germany of the work of John Bringeret (Printed in 1615.),
      asserting that all the languages of the earth were known to the genuine
      Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross. Did Zanoni belong to this mystical
      Fraternity, who, in an earlier age, boasted of secrets of which the
      Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone was but the least; who considered themselves the heirs
      of all that the Chaldeans, the Magi, the Gymnosophists, and the Platonists
      had taught; and who differed from all the darker Sons of Magic in the
      virtue of their lives, the purity of their doctrines, and their insisting,
      as the foundation of all wisdom, on the subjugation of the senses, and the
      intensity of Religious Faith?&mdash;a glorious sect, if they lied not!
      And, in truth, if Zanoni had powers beyond the race of worldly sages, they
      seemed not unworthily exercised. The little known of his life was in his
      favour. Some acts, not of indiscriminate, but judicious generosity and
      beneficence, were recorded; in repeating which, still, however, the
      narrators shook their heads, and expressed surprise how a stranger should
      have possessed so minute a knowledge of the quiet and obscure distresses
      he had relieved. Two or three sick persons, when abandoned by their
      physicians, he had visited, and conferred with alone. They had recovered:
      they ascribed to him their recovery; yet they could not tell by what
      medicines they had been healed. They could only depose that he came,
      conversed with them, and they were cured; it usually, however, happened
      that a deep sleep had preceded the recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another circumstance was also beginning to be remarked, and spoke yet more
      in his commendation. Those with whom he principally associated&mdash;the
      gay, the dissipated, the thoughtless, the sinners and publicans of the
      more polished world&mdash;all appeared rapidly, yet insensibly to
      themselves, to awaken to purer thoughts and more regulated lives. Even
      Cetoxa, the prince of gallants, duellists, and gamesters, was no longer
      the same man since the night of the singular events which he had related
      to Glyndon. The first trace of his reform was in his retirement from the
      gaming-houses; the next was his reconciliation with an hereditary enemy of
      his house, whom it had been his constant object for the last six years to
      entangle in such a quarrel as might call forth his inimitable manoeuvre of
      the stoccata. Nor when Cetoxa and his young companions were heard to speak
      of Zanoni, did it seem that this change had been brought about by any
      sober lectures or admonitions. They all described Zanoni as a man keenly
      alive to enjoyment: of manners the reverse of formal,&mdash;not precisely
      gay, but equable, serene, and cheerful; ever ready to listen to the talk
      of others, however idle, or to charm all ears with an inexhaustible fund
      of brilliant anecdote and worldly experience. All manners, all nations,
      all grades of men, seemed familiar to him. He was reserved only if
      allusion were ever ventured to his birth or history.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more general opinion of his origin certainly seemed the more
      plausible. His riches, his familiarity with the languages of the East, his
      residence in India, a certain gravity which never deserted his most
      cheerful and familiar hours, the lustrous darkness of his eyes and hair,
      and even the peculiarities of his shape, in the delicate smallness of the
      hands, and the Arab-like turn of the stately head, appeared to fix him as
      belonging to one at least of the Oriental races. And a dabbler in the
      Eastern tongues even sought to reduce the simple name of Zanoni, which a
      century before had been borne by an inoffensive naturalist of Bologna (The
      author of two works on botany and rare plants.), to the radicals of the
      extinct language. Zan was unquestionably the Chaldean appellation for the
      sun. Even the Greeks, who mutilated every Oriental name, had retained the
      right one in this case, as the Cretan inscription on the tomb of Zeus (Ode
      megas keitai Zan.&mdash;&ldquo;Cyril contra Julian.&rdquo; (Here lies great Jove.))
      significantly showed. As to the rest, the Zan, or Zaun, was, with the
      Sidonians, no uncommon prefix to On. Adonis was but another name for
      Zanonas, whose worship in Sidon Hesychius records. To this profound and
      unanswerable derivation Mervale listened with great attention, and
      observed that he now ventured to announce an erudite discovery he himself
      had long since made,&mdash;namely, that the numerous family of Smiths in
      England were undoubtedly the ancient priests of the Phrygian Apollo.
      &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;was not Apollo&rsquo;s surname, in Phrygia, Smintheus? How
      clear all the ensuing corruptions of the august name,&mdash;Smintheus,
      Smitheus, Smithe, Smith! And even now, I may remark that the more ancient
      branches of that illustrious family, unconsciously anxious to approximate
      at least by a letter nearer to the true title, take a pious pleasure in
      writing their names Smith<i>e</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The philologist was much struck with this discovery, and begged Mervale&rsquo;s
      permission to note it down as an illustration suitable to a work he was
      about to publish on the origin of languages, to be called &ldquo;Babel,&rdquo; and
      published in three quartos by subscription.

      CHAPTER 2.VII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Learn to be poor in spirit, my son, if you would penetrate that
     sacred night which environs truth.  Learn of the Sages to allow
     to the Devils no power in Nature, since the fatal stone has shut
     &lsquo;em up in the depth of the abyss.  Learn of the Philosophers
     always to look for natural causes in all extraordinary events;
     and when such natural causes are wanting, recur to God.&mdash;The
     Count de Gabalis.
</pre>
    <p>
      All these additions to his knowledge of Zanoni, picked up in the various
      lounging-places and resorts that he frequented, were unsatisfactory to
      Glyndon. That night Viola did not perform at the theatre; and the next
      day, still disturbed by bewildered fancies, and averse to the sober and
      sarcastic companionship of Mervale, Glyndon sauntered musingly into the
      public gardens, and paused under the very tree under which he had first
      heard the voice that had exercised upon his mind so singular an influence.
      The gardens were deserted. He threw himself on one of the seats placed
      beneath the shade; and again, in the midst of his reverie, the same cold
      shudder came over him which Zanoni had so distinctly defined, and to which
      he had ascribed so extraordinary a cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      He roused himself with a sudden effort, and started to see, seated next
      him, a figure hideous enough to have personated one of the malignant
      beings of whom Zanoni had spoken. It was a small man, dressed in a fashion
      strikingly at variance with the elaborate costume of the day: an
      affectation of homeliness and poverty approaching to squalor, in the loose
      trousers, coarse as a ship&rsquo;s sail; in the rough jacket, which appeared
      rent wilfully into holes; and the black, ragged, tangled locks that
      streamed from their confinement under a woollen cap, accorded but ill with
      other details which spoke of comparative wealth. The shirt, open at the
      throat, was fastened by a brooch of gaudy stones; and two pendent massive
      gold chains announced the foppery of two watches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s figure, if not absolutely deformed, was yet marvellously
      ill-favoured; his shoulders high and square; his chest flattened, as if
      crushed in; his gloveless hands were knotted at the joints, and, large,
      bony, and muscular, dangled from lean, emaciated wrists, as if not
      belonging to them. His features had the painful distortion sometimes seen
      in the countenance of a cripple,&mdash;large, exaggerated, with the nose
      nearly touching the chin; the eyes small, but glowing with a cunning fire
      as they dwelt on Glyndon; and the mouth was twisted into a grin that
      displayed rows of jagged, black, broken teeth. Yet over this frightful
      face there still played a kind of disagreeable intelligence, an expression
      at once astute and bold; and as Glyndon, recovering from the first
      impression, looked again at his neighbour, he blushed at his own dismay,
      and recognised a French artist, with whom he had formed an acquaintance,
      and who was possessed of no inconsiderable talents in his calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, it was to be remarked that this creature, whose externals were so
      deserted by the Graces, particularly delighted in designs aspiring to
      majesty and grandeur. Though his colouring was hard and shallow, as was
      that generally of the French school at the time, his DRAWINGS were
      admirable for symmetry, simple elegance, and classic vigour; at the same
      time they unquestionably wanted ideal grace. He was fond of selecting
      subjects from Roman history, rather than from the copious world of Grecian
      beauty, or those still more sublime stories of scriptural record from
      which Raphael and Michael Angelo borrowed their inspirations. His grandeur
      was that not of gods and saints, but mortals. His delineation of beauty
      was that which the eye cannot blame and the soul does not acknowledge. In
      a word, as it was said of Dionysius, he was an Anthropographos, or Painter
      of Men. It was also a notable contradiction in this person, who was
      addicted to the most extravagant excesses in every passion, whether of
      hate or love, implacable in revenge, and insatiable in debauch, that he
      was in the habit of uttering the most beautiful sentiments of exalted
      purity and genial philanthropy. The world was not good enough for him; he
      was, to use the expressive German phrase, A WORLD-BETTERER! Nevertheless,
      his sarcastic lip often seemed to mock the sentiments he uttered, as if it
      sought to insinuate that he was above even the world he would construct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, this painter was in close correspondence with the Republicans of
      Paris, and was held to be one of those missionaries whom, from the
      earliest period of the Revolution, the regenerators of mankind were
      pleased to despatch to the various states yet shackled, whether by actual
      tyranny or wholesome laws. Certainly, as the historian of Italy (Botta.)
      has observed, there was no city in Italy where these new doctrines would
      be received with greater favour than Naples, partly from the lively temper
      of the people, principally because the most hateful feudal privileges,
      however partially curtailed some years before by the great minister,
      Tanuccini, still presented so many daily and practical evils as to make
      change wear a more substantial charm than the mere and meretricious bloom
      on the cheek of the harlot, Novelty. This man, whom I will call Jean
      Nicot, was, therefore, an oracle among the younger and bolder spirits of
      Naples; and before Glyndon had met Zanoni, the former had not been among
      the least dazzled by the eloquent aspirations of the hideous
      philanthropist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so long since we have met, cher confrere,&rdquo; said Nicot, drawing his
      seat nearer to Glyndon&rsquo;s, &ldquo;that you cannot be surprised that I see you
      with delight, and even take the liberty to intrude on your meditations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were of no agreeable nature,&rdquo; said Glyndon; &ldquo;and never was intrusion
      more welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be charmed to hear,&rdquo; said Nicot, drawing several letters from
      his bosom, &ldquo;that the good work proceeds with marvellous rapidity.
      Mirabeau, indeed, is no more; but, mort Diable! the French people are now
      a Mirabeau themselves.&rdquo; With this remark, Monsieur Nicot proceeded to read
      and to comment upon several animated and interesting passages in his
      correspondence, in which the word virtue was introduced twenty-seven
      times, and God not once. And then, warmed by the cheering prospects thus
      opened to him, he began to indulge in those anticipations of the future,
      the outline of which we have already seen in the eloquent extravagance of
      Condorcet. All the old virtues were dethroned for a new Pantheon:
      patriotism was a narrow sentiment; philanthropy was to be its successor.
      No love that did not embrace all mankind, as warm for Indus and the Pole
      as for the hearth of home, was worthy the breast of a generous man.
      Opinion was to be free as air; and in order to make it so, it was
      necessary to exterminate all those whose opinions were not the same as
      Mons. Jean Nicot&rsquo;s. Much of this amused, much revolted Glyndon; but when
      the painter turned to dwell upon a science that all should comprehend, and
      the results of which all should enjoy,&mdash;a science that, springing
      from the soil of equal institutions and equal mental cultivation, should
      give to all the races of men wealth without labour, and a life longer than
      the Patriarchs&rsquo;, without care,&mdash;then Glyndon listened with interest
      and admiration, not unmixed with awe. &ldquo;Observe,&rdquo; said Nicot, &ldquo;how much
      that we now cherish as a virtue will then be rejected as meanness. Our
      oppressors, for instance, preach to us of the excellence of gratitude.
      Gratitude, the confession of inferiority! What so hateful to a noble
      spirit as the humiliating sense of obligation? But where there is equality
      there can be no means for power thus to enslave merit. The benefactor and
      the client will alike cease, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in the mean time,&rdquo; said a low voice, at hand,&mdash;&ldquo;in the mean
      time, Jean Nicot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two artists started, and Glyndon recognised Zanoni.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed with a brow of unusual sternness on Nicot, who, lumped together
      as he sat, looked up at him askew, and with an expression of fear and
      dismay upon his distorted countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ho, ho! Messire Jean Nicot, thou who fearest neither God nor Devil, why
      fearest thou the eye of a man?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the first time I have been a witness to your opinions on the
      infirmity of gratitude,&rdquo; said Zanoni.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicot suppressed an exclamation, and, after gloomily surveying Zanoni with
      an eye villanous and sinister, but full of hate impotent and unutterable,
      said, &ldquo;I know you not,&mdash;what would you of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your absence. Leave us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicot sprang forward a step, with hands clenched, and showing his teeth
      from ear to ear, like a wild beast incensed. Zanoni stood motionless, and
      smiled at him in scorn. Nicot halted abruptly, as if fixed and fascinated
      by the look, shivered from head to foot, and sullenly, and with a visible
      effort, as if impelled by a power not his own, turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon&rsquo;s eyes followed him in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what know you of this man?&rdquo; said Zanoni.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know him as one like myself,&mdash;a follower of art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of ART! Do not so profane that glorious word. What Nature is to God, art
      should be to man,&mdash;a sublime, beneficent, genial, and warm creation.
      That wretch may be a PAINTER, not an ARTIST.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pardon me if I ask what YOU know of one you thus disparage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know thus much, that you are beneath my care if it be necessary to warn
      you against him; his own lips show the hideousness of his heart. Why
      should I tell you of the crimes he has committed? He SPEAKS crime!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not seem, Signor Zanoni, to be one of the admirers of the dawning
      Revolution. Perhaps you are prejudiced against the man because you dislike
      the opinions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What opinions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon paused, somewhat puzzled to define; but at length he said, &ldquo;Nay, I
      must wrong you; for you, of all men, I suppose, cannot discredit the
      doctrine that preaches the infinite improvement of the human species.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right; the few in every age improve the many; the many now may be
      as wise as the few were; but improvement is at a standstill, if you tell
      me that the many now are as wise as the few ARE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I comprehend you; you will not allow the law of universal equality!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Law! If the whole world conspired to enforce the falsehood they could not
      make it LAW. Level all conditions to-day, and you only smooth away all
      obstacles to tyranny to-morrow. A nation that aspires to EQUALITY is unfit
      for FREEDOM. Throughout all creation, from the archangel to the worm, from
      Olympus to the pebble, from the radiant and completed planet to the nebula
      that hardens through ages of mist and slime into the habitable world, the
      first law of Nature is inequality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harsh doctrine, if applied to states. Are the cruel disparities of life
      never to be removed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disparities of the PHYSICAL life? Oh, let us hope so. But disparities of
      the INTELLECTUAL and the MORAL, never! Universal equality of intelligence,
      of mind, of genius, of virtue!&mdash;no teacher left to the world! no men
      wiser, better than others,&mdash;were it not an impossible condition, WHAT
      A HOPELESS PROSPECT FOR HUMANITY! No, while the world lasts, the sun will
      gild the mountain-top before it shines upon the plain. Diffuse all the
      knowledge the earth contains equally over all mankind to-day, and some men
      will be wiser than the rest to-morrow. And THIS is not a harsh, but a
      loving law,&mdash;the REAL law of improvement; the wiser the few in one
      generation, the wiser will be the multitude the next!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Zanoni thus spoke, they moved on through the smiling gardens, and the
      beautiful bay lay sparkling in the noontide. A gentle breeze just cooled
      the sunbeam, and stirred the ocean; and in the inexpressible clearness of
      the atmosphere there was something that rejoiced the senses. The very soul
      seemed to grow lighter and purer in that lucid air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And these men, to commence their era of improvement and equality, are
      jealous even of the Creator. They would deny an intelligence,&mdash;a
      God!&rdquo; said Zanoni, as if involuntarily. &ldquo;Are you an artist, and, looking
      on the world, can you listen to such a dogma? Between God and genius there
      is a necessary link,&mdash;there is almost a correspondent language. Well
      said the Pythagorean (Sextus, the Pythagorean.), &lsquo;A good intellect is the
      chorus of divinity.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Struck and touched with these sentiments, which he little expected to fall
      from one to whom he ascribed those powers which the superstitions of
      childhood ascribe to the darker agencies, Glyndon said: &ldquo;And yet you have
      confessed that your life, separated from that of others, is one that man
      should dread to share. Is there, then, a connection between magic and
      religion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Magic!&rdquo; And what is magic! When the traveller beholds in Persia the ruins
      of palaces and temples, the ignorant inhabitants inform him they were the
      work of magicians. What is beyond their own power, the vulgar cannot
      comprehend to be lawfully in the power of others. But if by magic you mean
      a perpetual research amongst all that is more latent and obscure in
      Nature, I answer, I profess that magic, and that he who does so comes but
      nearer to the fountain of all belief. Knowest thou not that magic was
      taught in the schools of old? But how, and by whom? As the last and most
      solemn lesson, by the Priests who ministered to the Temple. (Psellus de
      Daemon (MS.)) And you, who would be a painter, is not there a magic also
      in that art you would advance? Must you not, after long study of the
      Beautiful that has been, seize upon new and airy combinations of a beauty
      that is to be? See you not that the grander art, whether of poet or of
      painter, ever seeking for the TRUE, abhors the REAL; that you must seize
      Nature as her master, not lackey her as her slave?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You demand mastery over the past, a conception of the future. Has not the
      art that is truly noble for its domain the future and the past? You would
      conjure the invisible beings to your charm; and what is painting but the
      fixing into substance the Invisible? Are you discontented with this world?
      This world was never meant for genius! To exist, it must create another.
      What magician can do more; nay, what science can do as much? There are two
      avenues from the little passions and the drear calamities of earth; both
      lead to heaven and away from hell,&mdash;art and science. But art is more
      godlike than science; science discovers, art creates. You have faculties
      that may command art; be contented with your lot. The astronomer who
      catalogues the stars cannot add one atom to the universe; the poet can
      call a universe from the atom; the chemist may heal with his drugs the
      infirmities of the human form; the painter, or the sculptor, fixes into
      everlasting youth forms divine, which no disease can ravage, and no years
      impair. Renounce those wandering fancies that lead you now to myself, and
      now to yon orator of the human race; to us two, who are the antipodes of
      each other! Your pencil is your wand; your canvas may raise Utopias fairer
      than Condorcet dreams of. I press not yet for your decision; but what man
      of genius ever asked more to cheer his path to the grave than love and
      glory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Glyndon, fixing his eyes earnestly on Zanoni, &ldquo;if there be a
      power to baffle the grave itself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanoni&rsquo;s brow darkened. &ldquo;And were this so,&rdquo; he said, after a pause, &ldquo;would
      it be so sweet a lot to outlive all you loved, and to recoil from every
      human tie? Perhaps the fairest immortality on earth is that of a noble
      name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not answer me,&mdash;you equivocate. I have read of the long lives
      far beyond the date common experience assigns to man,&rdquo; persisted Glyndon,
      &ldquo;which some of the alchemists enjoyed. Is the golden elixir but a fable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If not, and these men discovered it, they died, because they refused to
      live! There may be a mournful warning in your conjecture. Turn once more
      to the easel and the canvas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Zanoni waved his hand, and, with downcast eyes and a slow step,
      bent his way back into the city.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 2.VIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The Goddess Wisdom.

     To some she is the goddess great;
     To some the milch cow of the field;
     Their care is but to calculate
     What butter she will yield.
     From Schiller.
</pre>
    <p>
      This last conversation with Zanoni left upon the mind of Glyndon a
      tranquillising and salutary effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the confused mists of his fancy glittered forth again those happy,
      golden schemes which part from the young ambition of art, to play in the
      air, to illumine the space like rays that kindle from the sun. And with
      these projects mingled also the vision of a love purer and serener than
      his life yet had known. His mind went back into that fair childhood of
      genius, when the forbidden fruit is not yet tasted, and we know of no land
      beyond the Eden which is gladdened by an Eve. Insensibly before him there
      rose the scenes of a home, with his art sufficing for all excitement, and
      Viola&rsquo;s love circling occupation with happiness and content; and in the
      midst of these fantasies of a future that might be at his command, he was
      recalled to the present by the clear, strong voice of Mervale, the man of
      common-sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whoever has studied the lives of persons in whom the imagination is
      stronger than the will, who suspect their own knowledge of actual life,
      and are aware of their facility to impressions, will have observed the
      influence which a homely, vigorous, worldly understanding obtains over
      such natures. It was thus with Glyndon. His friend had often extricated
      him from danger, and saved him from the consequences of imprudence; and
      there was something in Mervale&rsquo;s voice alone that damped his enthusiasm,
      and often made him yet more ashamed of noble impulses than weak conduct.
      For Mervale, though a downright honest man, could not sympathise with the
      extravagance of generosity any more than with that of presumption and
      credulity. He walked the straight line of life, and felt an equal contempt
      for the man who wandered up the hill-sides, no matter whether to chase a
      butterfly, or to catch a prospect of the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you your thoughts, Clarence,&rdquo; said Mervale, laughing, &ldquo;though
      I am no Zanoni. I know them by the moisture of your eyes, and the
      half-smile on your lips. You are musing upon that fair perdition,&mdash;the
      little singer of San Carlo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little singer of San Carlo! Glyndon coloured as he answered,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you speak thus of her if she were my wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! for then any contempt I might venture to feel would be for yourself.
      One may dislike the duper, but it is the dupe that one despises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure that I should be the dupe in such a union? Where can I find
      one so lovely and so innocent,&mdash;where one whose virtue has been tried
      by such temptation? Does even a single breath of slander sully the name of
      Viola Pisani?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not all the gossip of Naples, and therefore cannot answer; but I
      know this, that in England no one would believe that a young Englishman,
      of good fortune and respectable birth, who marries a singer from the
      theatre of Naples, has not been lamentably taken in. I would save you from
      a fall of position so irretrievable. Think how many mortifications you
      will be subjected to; how many young men will visit at your house,&mdash;and
      how many young wives will as carefully avoid it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can choose my own career, to which commonplace society is not
      essential. I can owe the respect of the world to my art, and not to the
      accidents of birth and fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, you still persist in your second folly,&mdash;the absurd
      ambition of daubing canvas. Heaven forbid I should say anything against
      the laudable industry of one who follows such a profession for the sake of
      subsistence; but with means and connections that will raise you in life,
      why voluntarily sink into a mere artist? As an accomplishment in leisure
      moments, it is all very well in its way; but as the occupation of
      existence, it is a frenzy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Artists have been the friends of princes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very rarely so, I fancy, in sober England. There in the great centre of
      political aristocracy, what men respect is the practical, not the ideal.
      Just suffer me to draw two pictures of my own. Clarence Glyndon returns to
      England; he marries a lady of fortune equal to his own, of friends and
      parentage that advance rational ambition. Clarence Glyndon, thus a wealthy
      and respectable man, of good talents, of bustling energies then
      concentrated, enters into practical life. He has a house at which he can
      receive those whose acquaintance is both advantage and honour; he has
      leisure which he can devote to useful studies; his reputation, built on a
      solid base, grows in men&rsquo;s mouths. He attaches himself to a party; he
      enters political life; and new connections serve to promote his objects.
      At the age of five-and-forty, what, in all probability, may Clarence
      Glyndon be? Since you are ambitious I leave that question for you to
      decide! Now turn to the other picture. Clarence Glyndon returns to England
      with a wife who can bring him no money, unless he lets her out on the
      stage; so handsome, that every one asks who she is, and every one hears,&mdash;the
      celebrated singer, Pisani. Clarence Glyndon shuts himself up to grind
      colours and paint pictures in the grand historical school, which nobody
      buys. There is even a prejudice against him, as not having studied in the
      Academy,&mdash;as being an amateur. Who is Mr. Clarence Glyndon? Oh, the
      celebrated Pisani&rsquo;s husband! What else? Oh, he exhibits those large
      pictures! Poor man! they have merit in their way; but Teniers and Watteau
      are more convenient, and almost as cheap. Clarence Glyndon, with an easy
      fortune while single, has a large family which his fortune, unaided by
      marriage, can just rear up to callings more plebeian than his own. He
      retires into the country, to save and to paint; he grows slovenly and
      discontented; &lsquo;the world does not appreciate him,&rsquo; he says, and he runs
      away from the world. At the age of forty-five what will be Clarence
      Glyndon? Your ambition shall decide that question also!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If all men were as worldly as you,&rdquo; said Glyndon, rising, &ldquo;there would
      never have been an artist or a poet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps we should do just as well without them,&rdquo; answered Mervale. &ldquo;Is it
      not time to think of dinner? The mullets here are remarkably fine!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER 2.IX.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Wollt ihr hoch auf ihren Flugeln schweben,
     Werft die Angst des Irdischen von euch!
     Fliehet aus dem engen dumpfen Leben
     In des Ideales Reich!
     &ldquo;Das Ideal und das Leben.&rdquo;
 
     Wouldst thou soar heavenward on its joyous wing?
     Cast off the earthly burden of the Real;
     High from this cramped and dungeoned being, spring
     Into the realm of the Ideal.
</pre>
    <p>
      As some injudicious master lowers and vitiates the taste of the student by
      fixing his attention to what he falsely calls the Natural, but which, in
      reality, is the Commonplace, and understands not that beauty in art is
      created by what Raphael so well describes,&mdash;namely, THE IDEA OF
      BEAUTY IN THE PAINTER&rsquo;S OWN MIND; and that in every art, whether its
      plastic expression be found in words or marble, colours or sounds, the
      servile imitation of Nature is the work of journeymen and tyros,&mdash;so
      in conduct the man of the world vitiates and lowers the bold enthusiasm of
      loftier natures by the perpetual reduction of whatever is generous and
      trustful to all that is trite and coarse. A great German poet has well
      defined the distinction between discretion and the larger wisdom. In the
      last there is a certain rashness which the first disdains,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The purblind see but the receding shore, Not that to which the bold wave
      wafts them o&rsquo;er.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet in this logic of the prudent and the worldly there is often a
      reasoning unanswerable of its kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must have a feeling,&mdash;a faith in whatever is self-sacrificing and
      divine, whether in religion or in art, in glory or in love; or
      Common-sense will reason you out of the sacrifice, and a syllogism will
      debase the Divine to an article in the market.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every true critic in art, from Aristotle and Pliny, from Winkelman and
      Vasari to Reynolds and Fuseli, has sought to instruct the painter that
      Nature is not to be copied, but EXALTED; that the loftiest order of art,
      selecting only the loftiest combinations, is the perpetual struggle of
      Humanity to approach the gods. The great painter, as the great author,
      embodies what is POSSIBLE to MAN, it is true, but what is not COMMON to
      MANKIND. There is truth in Hamlet; in Macbeth, and his witches; in
      Desdemona; in Othello; in Prospero, and in Caliban; there is truth in the
      cartoons of Raphael; there is truth in the Apollo, the Antinous, and the
      Laocoon. But you do not meet the originals of the words, the cartoons, or
      the marble, in Oxford Street or St. James&rsquo;s. All these, to return to
      Raphael, are the creatures of the idea in the artist&rsquo;s mind. This idea is
      not inborn, it has come from an intense study. But that study has been of
      the ideal that can be raised from the positive and the actual into
      grandeur and beauty. The commonest model becomes full of exquisite
      suggestions to him who has formed this idea; a Venus of flesh and blood
      would be vulgarised by the imitation of him who has not.
    </p>
    <p>
      When asked where he got his models, Guido summoned a common porter from
      his calling, and drew from a mean original a head of surpassing beauty. It
      resembled the porter, but idealised the porter to the hero. It was true,
      but it was not real. There are critics who will tell you that the Boor of
      Teniers is more true to Nature than the Porter of Guido! The commonplace
      public scarcely understand the idealising principle, even in art; for high
      art is an acquired taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to come to my comparison. Still less is the kindred principle
      comprehended in conduct. And the advice of worldly prudence would as often
      deter from the risks of virtue as from the punishments of vice; yet in
      conduct, as in art, there is an idea of the great and beautiful, by which
      men should exalt the hackneyed and the trite of life. Now Glyndon felt the
      sober prudence of Mervale&rsquo;s reasonings; he recoiled from the probable
      picture placed before him, in his devotion to the one master-talent he
      possessed, and the one master-passion that, rightly directed, might purify
      his whole being as a strong wind purifies the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though he could not bring himself to decide in the teeth of so
      rational a judgment, neither could he resolve at once to abandon the
      pursuit of Viola. Fearful of being influenced by Zanoni&rsquo;s counsels and his
      own heart, he had for the last two days shunned an interview with the
      young actress. But after a night following his last conversation with
      Zanoni, and that we have just recorded with Mervale,&mdash;a night
      coloured by dreams so distinct as to seem prophetic, dreams that appeared
      so to shape his future according to the hints of Zanoni that he could have
      fancied Zanoni himself had sent them from the house of sleep to haunt his
      pillow,&mdash;he resolved once more to seek Viola; and though without a
      definite or distinct object, he yielded himself up to the impulse of his
      heart.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 2.X.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     O sollecito dubbio e fredda tema
     Che pensando l&rsquo;accresci.
     Tasso, Canzone vi.

     (O anxious doubt and chilling fear that grows by thinking.)
</pre>
    <p>
      She was seated outside her door,&mdash;the young actress! The sea before
      her in that heavenly bay seemed literally to sleep in the arms of the
      shore; while, to the right, not far off, rose the dark and tangled crags
      to which the traveller of to-day is duly brought to gaze on the tomb of
      Virgil, or compare with the cavern of Posilipo the archway of Highgate
      Hill. There were a few fisherman loitering by the cliffs, on which their
      nets were hung to dry; and at a distance the sound of some rustic pipe
      (more common at that day than at this), mingled now and then with the
      bells of the lazy mules, broke the voluptuous silence,&mdash;the silence
      of declining noon on the shores of Naples; never, till you have enjoyed
      it, never, till you have felt its enervating but delicious charm, believe
      that you can comprehend all the meaning of the Dolce far niente (The
      pleasure of doing nothing.); and when that luxury has been known, when you
      have breathed that atmosphere of fairy-land, then you will no longer
      wonder why the heart ripens into fruit so sudden and so rich beneath the
      rosy skies and the glorious sunshine of the South.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the actress were fixed on the broad blue deep beyond. In the
      unwonted negligence of her dress might be traced the abstraction of her
      mind. Her beautiful hair was gathered up loosely, and partially bandaged
      by a kerchief whose purple colour served to deepen the golden hue of her
      tresses. A stray curl escaped and fell down the graceful neck. A loose
      morning-robe, girded by a sash, left the breeze. That came ever and anon
      from the sea, to die upon the bust half disclosed; and the tiny slipper,
      that Cinderella might have worn, seemed a world too wide for the tiny foot
      which it scarcely covered. It might be the heat of the day that deepened
      the soft bloom of the cheeks, and gave an unwonted languor to the large,
      dark eyes. In all the pomp of her stage attire,&mdash;in all the flush of
      excitement before the intoxicating lamps,&mdash;never had Viola looked so
      lovely.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the side of the actress, and filling up the threshold,&mdash;stood
      Gionetta, with her arms thrust to the elbow in two huge pockets on either
      side of her gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I assure you,&rdquo; said the nurse, in that sharp, quick, ear-splitting
      tone in which the old women of the South are more than a match for those
      of the North,&mdash;&ldquo;but I assure you, my darling, that there is not a
      finer cavalier in all Naples, nor a more beautiful, than this Inglese; and
      I am told that all these Inglesi are much richer than they seem. Though
      they have no trees in their country, poor people! and instead of
      twenty-four they have only twelve hours to the day, yet I hear that they
      shoe their horses with scudi; and since they cannot (the poor heretics!)
      turn grapes into wine, for they have no grapes, they turn gold into
      physic, and take a glass or two of pistoles whenever they are troubled
      with the colic. But you don&rsquo;t hear me, little pupil of my eyes,&mdash;you
      don&rsquo;t hear me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And these things are whispered of Zanoni!&rdquo; said Viola, half to herself,
      and unheeding Gionetta&rsquo;s eulogies on Glyndon and the English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed Maria! do not talk of this terrible Zanoni. You may be sure that
      his beautiful face, like his yet more beautiful pistoles, is only
      witchcraft. I look at the money he gave me the other night, every quarter
      of an hour, to see whether it has not turned into pebbles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you then really believe,&rdquo; said Viola, with timid earnestness, &ldquo;that
      sorcery still exists?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe! Do I believe in the blessed San Gennaro? How do you think he
      cured old Filippo the fisherman, when the doctor gave him up? How do you
      think he has managed himself to live at least these three hundred years?
      How do you think he fascinates every one to his bidding with a look, as
      the vampires do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, is this only witchcraft? It is like it,&mdash;it must be!&rdquo; murmured
      Viola, turning very pale. Gionetta herself was scarcely more superstitious
      than the daughter of the musician. And her very innocence, chilled at the
      strangeness of virgin passion, might well ascribe to magic what hearts
      more experienced would have resolved to love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, why has this great Prince di &mdash; been so terrified by him?
      Why has he ceased to persecute us? Why has he been so quiet and still? Is
      there no sorcery in all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think you, then,&rdquo; said Viola, with sweet inconsistency, &ldquo;that I owe that
      happiness and safety to his protection? Oh, let me so believe! Be silent,
      Gionetta! Why have I only thee and my own terrors to consult? O beautiful
      sun!&rdquo; and the girl pressed her hand to her heart with wild energy; &ldquo;thou
      lightest every spot but this. Go, Gionetta! leave me alone,&mdash;leave
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And indeed it is time I should leave you; for the polenta will be
      spoiled, and you have eat nothing all day. If you don&rsquo;t eat you will lose
      your beauty, my darling, and then nobody will care for you. Nobody cares
      for us when we grow ugly,&mdash;I know that; and then you must, like old
      Gionetta, get some Viola of your own to spoil. I&rsquo;ll go and see to the
      polenta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since I have known this man,&rdquo; said the girl, half aloud,&mdash;&ldquo;since his
      dark eyes have haunted me, I am no longer the same. I long to escape from
      myself,&mdash;to glide with the sunbeam over the hill-tops; to become
      something that is not of earth. Phantoms float before me at night; and a
      fluttering, like the wing of a bird, within my heart, seems as if the
      spirit were terrified, and would break its cage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While murmuring these incoherent rhapsodies, a step that she did not hear
      approached the actress, and a light hand touched her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Viola!&mdash;bellissima!&mdash;Viola!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned, and saw Glyndon. The sight of his fair young face calmed her
      at once. His presence gave her pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Viola,&rdquo; said the Englishman, taking her hand, and drawing her again to
      the bench from which she had risen, as he seated himself beside her, &ldquo;you
      shall hear me speak! You must know already that I love thee! It has not
      been pity or admiration alone that has led me ever and ever to thy dear
      side; reasons there may have been why I have not spoken, save by my eyes,
      before; but this day&mdash;I know not how it is&mdash;I feel a more
      sustained and settled courage to address thee, and learn the happiest or
      the worst. I have rivals, I know,&mdash;rivals who are more powerful than
      the poor artist; are they also more favoured?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Viola blushed faintly; but her countenance was grave and distressed.
      Looking down, and marking some hieroglyphical figures in the dust with the
      point of her slipper, she said, with some hesitation, and a vain attempt
      to be gay, &ldquo;Signor, whoever wastes his thoughts on an actress must submit
      to have rivals. It is our unhappy destiny not to be sacred even to
      ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you do not love this destiny, glittering though it seem; your heart
      is not in the vocation which your gifts adorn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, no!&rdquo; said the actress, her eyes filling with tears. &ldquo;Once I loved to
      be the priestess of song and music; now I feel only that it is a miserable
      lot to be slave to a multitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fly, then, with me,&rdquo; said the artist, passionately; &ldquo;quit forever the
      calling that divides that heart I would have all my own. Share my fate now
      and forever,&mdash;my pride, my delight, my ideal! Thou shalt inspire my
      canvas and my song; thy beauty shall be made at once holy and renowned. In
      the galleries of princes, crowds shall gather round the effigy of a Venus
      or a Saint, and a whisper shall break forth, &lsquo;It is Viola Pisani!&rsquo; Ah!
      Viola, I adore thee; tell me that I do not worship in vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art good and fair,&rdquo; said Viola, gazing on her lover, as he pressed
      nearer to her, and clasped her hand in his; &ldquo;but what should I give thee
      in return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love, love,&mdash;only love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sister&rsquo;s love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, speak not with such cruel coldness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all I have for thee. Listen to me, signor: when I look on your
      face, when I hear your voice, a certain serene and tranquil calm creeps
      over and lulls thoughts,&mdash;oh, how feverish, how wild! When thou art
      gone, the day seems a shade more dark; but the shadow soon flies. I miss
      thee not; I think not of thee: no, I love thee not; and I will give myself
      only where I love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I would teach thee to love me; fear it not. Nay, such love as thou
      describest, in our tranquil climates, is the love of innocence and youth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of innocence!&rdquo; said Viola. &ldquo;Is it so? Perhaps&mdash;&rdquo; She paused, and
      added, with an effort, &ldquo;Foreigner! and wouldst thou wed the orphan? Ah,
      THOU at least art generous! It is not the innocence thou wouldst destroy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon drew back, conscience-stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it may not be!&rdquo; she said, rising, but not conscious of the thoughts,
      half of shame, half suspicion, that passed through the mind of her lover.
      &ldquo;Leave me, and forget me. You do not understand, you could not comprehend,
      the nature of her whom you think to love. From my childhood upward, I have
      felt as if I were marked out for some strange and preternatural doom; as
      if I were singled from my kind. This feeling (and, oh! at times it is one
      of delirious and vague delight, at others of the darkest gloom) deepens
      within me day by day. It is like the shadow of twilight, spreading slowly
      and solemnly around. My hour approaches: a little while, and it will be
      night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, Glyndon listened with visible emotion and perturbation.
      &ldquo;Viola!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as she ceased, &ldquo;your words more than ever enchain
      me to you. As you feel, I feel. I, too, have been ever haunted with a
      chill and unearthly foreboding. Amidst the crowds of men I have felt
      alone. In all my pleasures, my toils, my pursuits, a warning voice has
      murmured in my ear, &lsquo;Time has a dark mystery in store for thy manhood.&rsquo; 
      When you spoke, it was as the voice of my own soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Viola gazed upon him in wonder and fear. Her countenance was as white as
      marble; and those features, so divine in their rare symmetry, might have
      served the Greek with a study for the Pythoness, when, from the mystic
      cavern and the bubbling spring, she first hears the voice of the inspiring
      god. Gradually the rigour and tension of that wonderful face relaxed, the
      colour returned, the pulse beat: the heart animated the frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said, turning partially aside,&mdash;&ldquo;tell me, have you
      seen&mdash;do you know&mdash;a stranger in this city,&mdash;one of whom
      wild stories are afloat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak of Zanoni? I have seen him: I know him,&mdash;and you? Ah, he,
      too, would be my rival!&mdash;he, too, would bear thee from me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You err,&rdquo; said Viola, hastily, and with a deep sigh; &ldquo;he pleads for you:
      he informed me of your love; he besought me not&mdash;not to reject it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange being! incomprehensible enigma! Why did you name him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! ah, I would have asked whether, when you first saw him, the
      foreboding, the instinct, of which you spoke, came on you more fearfully,
      more intelligibly than before; whether you felt at once repelled from him,
      yet attracted towards him; whether you felt,&rdquo; and the actress spoke with
      hurried animation, &ldquo;that with HIM was connected the secret of your life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this I felt,&rdquo; answered Glyndon, in a trembling voice, &ldquo;the first time
      I was in his presence. Though all around me was gay,&mdash;music, amidst
      lamp-lit trees, light converse near, and heaven without a cloud above,&mdash;my
      knees knocked together, my hair bristled, and my blood curdled like ice.
      Since then he has divided my thoughts with thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more, no more!&rdquo; said Viola, in a stifled tone; &ldquo;there must be the hand
      of fate in this. I can speak to you no more now. Farewell!&rdquo; She sprung
      past him into the house, and closed the door. Glyndon did not follow her,
      nor, strange as it may seem, was he so inclined. The thought and
      recollection of that moonlit hour in the gardens, of the strange address
      of Zanoni, froze up all human passion. Viola herself, if not forgotten,
      shrunk back like a shadow into the recesses of his breast. He shivered as
      he stepped into the sunlight, and musingly retraced his steps into the
      more populous parts of that liveliest of Italian cities.

     But that which especially distinguishes the brotherhood is their
     marvellous knowledge of all the resources of medical art.  They
     work not by charms, but simples.
     &mdash;&ldquo;MS.  Account of the Origin and Attributes of the true
     Rosicrucians,&rdquo; by J. Von D&mdash;.
</pre>
    <p>
      At this time it chanced that Viola had the opportunity to return the
      kindness shown to her by the friendly musician whose house had received
      and sheltered her when first left an orphan on the world. Old Bernardi had
      brought up three sons to the same profession as himself, and they had
      lately left Naples to seek their fortunes in the wealthier cities of
      Northern Europe, where the musical market was less overstocked. There was
      only left to glad the household of his aged wife and himself, a lively,
      prattling, dark-eyed girl of some eight years old, the child of his second
      son, whose mother had died in giving her birth. It so happened that, about
      a month previous to the date on which our story has now entered, a
      paralytic affection had disabled Bernardi from the duties of his calling.
      He had been always a social, harmless, improvident, generous fellow&mdash;living
      on his gains from day to day, as if the day of sickness and old age never
      was to arrive. Though he received a small allowance for his past services,
      it ill sufficed for his wants,; neither was he free from debt. Poverty
      stood at his hearth,&mdash;when Viola&rsquo;s grateful smile and liberal hand
      came to chase the grim fiend away. But it is not enough to a heart truly
      kind to send and give; more charitable is it to visit and console. &ldquo;Forget
      not thy father&rsquo;s friend.&rdquo; So almost daily went the bright idol of Naples
      to the house of Bernardi. Suddenly a heavier affliction than either
      poverty or the palsy befell the old musician. His grandchild, his little
      Beatrice, fell ill, suddenly and dangerously ill, of one of those rapid
      fevers common to the South; and Viola was summoned from her strange and
      fearful reveries of love or fancy, to the sick-bed of the young sufferer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child was exceedingly fond of Viola, and the old people thought that
      her mere presence would bring healing; but when Viola arrived, Beatrice
      was insensible. Fortunately there was no performance that evening at San
      Carlo, and she resolved to stay the night and partake its fearful cares
      and dangerous vigil.
    </p>
    <p>
      But during the night the child grew worse, the physician (the leechcraft
      has never been very skilful at Naples) shook his powdered head, kept his
      aromatics at his nostrils, administered his palliatives, and departed. Old
      Bernardi seated himself by the bedside in stern silence; here was the last
      tie that bound him to life. Well, let the anchor break and the battered
      ship go down! It was an iron resolve, more fearful than sorrow. An old
      man, with one foot in the grave, watching by the couch of a dying child,
      is one of the most awful spectacles in human calamities. The wife was more
      active, more bustling, more hopeful, and more tearful. Viola took heed of
      all three. But towards dawn, Beatrice&rsquo;s state became so obviously
      alarming, that Viola herself began to despair. At this time she saw the
      old woman suddenly rise from before the image of the saint at which she
      had been kneeling, wrap herself in her cloak and hood, and quietly quit
      the chamber. Viola stole after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is cold for thee, good mother, to brave the air; let me go for the
      physician?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child, I am not going to him. I have heard of one in the city who has
      been tender to the poor, and who, they say, has cured the sick when
      physicians failed. I will go and say to him, &lsquo;Signor, we are beggars in
      all else, but yesterday we were rich in love. We are at the close of life,
      but we lived in our grandchild&rsquo;s childhood. Give us back our wealth,&mdash;give
      us back our youth. Let us die blessing God that the thing we love survives
      us.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was gone. Why did thy heart beat, Viola? The infant&rsquo;s sharp cry of
      pain called her back to the couch; and there still sat the old man,
      unconscious of his wife&rsquo;s movements, not stirring, his eyes glazing fast
      as they watched the agonies of that slight frame. By degrees the wail of
      pain died into a low moan,&mdash;the convulsions grew feebler, but more
      frequent; the glow of fever faded into the blue, pale tinge that settles
      into the last bloodless marble.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daylight came broader and clearer through the casement; steps were
      heard on the stairs,&mdash;the old woman entered hastily; she rushed to
      the bed, cast a glance on the patient, &ldquo;She lives yet, signor, she lives!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Viola raised her eyes,&mdash;the child&rsquo;s head was pillowed on her bosom,&mdash;and
      she beheld Zanoni. He smiled on her with a tender and soft approval, and
      took the infant from her arms. Yet even then, as she saw him bending
      silently over that pale face, a superstitious fear mingled with her hopes.
      &ldquo;Was it by lawful&mdash;by holy art that&mdash;&rdquo; her self-questioning
      ceased abruptly; for his dark eye turned to her as if he read her soul,
      and his aspect accused her conscience for its suspicion, for it spoke
      reproach not unmingled with disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be comforted,&rdquo; he said, gently turning to the old man, &ldquo;the danger is not
      beyond the reach of human skill;&rdquo; and, taking from his bosom a small
      crystal vase, he mingled a few drops with water. No sooner did this
      medicine moisten the infant&rsquo;s lips, than it seemed to produce an
      astonishing effect. The colour revived rapidly on the lips and cheeks; in
      a few moments the sufferer slept calmly, and with the regular breathing of
      painless sleep. And then the old man rose, rigidly, as a corpse might
      rise,&mdash;looked down, listened, and creeping gently away, stole to the
      corner of the room, and wept, and thanked Heaven!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, old Bernardi had been, hitherto, but a cold believer; sorrow had
      never before led him aloft from earth. Old as he was, he had never before
      thought as the old should think of death,&mdash;that endangered life of
      the young had wakened up the careless soul of age. Zanoni whispered to the
      wife, and she drew the old man quietly from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dost thou fear to leave me an hour with thy charge, Viola? Thinkest thou
      still that this knowledge is of the Fiend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Viola, humbled and yet rejoiced, &ldquo;forgive me, forgive me,
      signor. Thou biddest the young live and the old pray. My thoughts never
      shall wrong thee more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the sun rose, Beatrice was out of danger; at noon Zanoni escaped
      from the blessings of the aged pair, and as he closed the door of the
      house, he found Viola awaiting him without.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood before him timidly, her hands crossed meekly on her bosom, her
      downcast eyes swimming with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not let me be the only one you leave unhappy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what cure can the herbs and anodynes effect for thee? If thou canst
      so readily believe ill of those who have aided and yet would serve thee,
      thy disease is of the heart; and&mdash;nay, weep not! nurse of the sick,
      and comforter of the sad, I should rather approve than chide thee. Forgive
      thee! Life, that ever needs forgiveness, has, for its first duty, to
      forgive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, do not forgive me yet. I do not deserve a pardon; for even now, while
      I feel how ungrateful I was to believe, suspect, aught injurious and false
      to my preserver, my tears flow from happiness, not remorse. Oh!&rdquo; she
      continued, with a simple fervour, unconscious, in her innocence and her
      generous emotions, of all the secrets she betrayed,&mdash;&ldquo;thou knowest
      not how bitter it was to believe thee not more good, more pure, more
      sacred than all the world. And when I saw thee,&mdash;the wealthy, the
      noble, coming from thy palace to minister to the sufferings of the hovel,&mdash;when
      I heard those blessings of the poor breathed upon thy parting footsteps, I
      felt my very self exalted,&mdash;good in thy goodness, noble at least in
      those thoughts that did NOT wrong thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thinkest thou, Viola, that in a mere act of science there is so much
      virtue? The commonest leech will tend the sick for his fee. Are prayers
      and blessings a less reward than gold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mine, then, are not worthless? Thou wilt accept of mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Viola!&rdquo; exclaimed Zanoni, with a sudden passion, that covered her
      face with blushes, &ldquo;thou only, methinks, on all the earth, hast the power
      to wound or delight me!&rdquo; He checked himself, and his face became grave and
      sad. &ldquo;And this,&rdquo; he added, in an altered tone, &ldquo;because, if thou wouldst
      heed my counsels, methinks I could guide a guileless heart to a happy
      fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy counsels! I will obey them all. Mould me to what thou wilt. In thine
      absence, I am as a child that fears every shadow in the dark; in thy
      presence, my soul expands, and the whole world seems calm with a celestial
      noonday. Do not deny to me that presence. I am fatherless and ignorant and
      alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanoni averted his face, and, after a moment&rsquo;s silence, replied calmly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so. Sister, I will visit thee again!&rdquo;

    <p>
      Who so happy as Viola now! A dark load was lifted from her heart: her step
      seemed to tread on air; she would have sung for very delight as she went
      gayly home. It is such happiness to the pure to love,&mdash;but oh, such
      more than happiness to believe in the worth of the one beloved. Between
      them there might be human obstacles,&mdash;wealth, rank, man&rsquo;s little
      world. But there was no longer that dark gulf which the imagination
      recoils to dwell on, and which separates forever soul from soul. He did
      not love her in return. Love her! But did she ask for love? Did she
      herself love? No; or she would never have been at once so humble and so
      bold. How merrily the ocean murmured in her ear; how radiant an aspect the
      commonest passer-by seemed to wear! She gained her home,&mdash;she looked
      upon the tree, glancing, with fantastic branches, in the sun. &ldquo;Yes,
      brother mine!&rdquo; she said, laughing in her joy, &ldquo;like thee, I HAVE struggled
      to the light!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had never hitherto, like the more instructed Daughters of the North,
      accustomed herself to that delicious Confessional, the transfusion of
      thought to writing. Now, suddenly, her heart felt an impulse; a new-born
      instinct, that bade it commune with itself, bade it disentangle its web of
      golden fancies,&mdash;made her wish to look upon her inmost self as in a
      glass. Upsprung from the embrace of Love and Soul&mdash;the Eros and the
      Psyche&mdash;their beautiful offspring, Genius! She blushed, she sighed,
      she trembled as she wrote. And from the fresh world that she had built for
      herself, she was awakened to prepare for the glittering stage. How dull
      became the music, how dim the scene, so exquisite and so bright of old.
      Stage, thou art the Fairy Land to the vision of the worldly. Fancy, whose
      music is not heard by men, whose scenes shift not by mortal hand, as the
      stage to the present world, art thou to the future and the past!

    <p>
      The next day, at noon, Zanoni visited Viola; and the next day and the next
      and again the next,&mdash;days that to her seemed like a special time set
      apart from the rest of life. And yet he never spoke to her in the language
      of flattery, and almost of adoration, to which she had been accustomed.
      Perhaps his very coldness, so gentle as it was, assisted to this
      mysterious charm. He talked to her much of her past life, and she was
      scarcely surprised (she now never thought of TERROR) to perceive how much
      of that past seemed known to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made her speak to him of her father; he made her recall some of the
      airs of Pisani&rsquo;s wild music. And those airs seemed to charm and lull him
      into reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As music was to the musician,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;may science be to the wise. Your
      father looked abroad in the world; all was discord to the fine sympathies
      that he felt with the harmonies that daily and nightly float to the throne
      of Heaven. Life, with its noisy ambition and its mean passions, is so poor
      and base! Out of his soul he created the life and the world for which his
      soul was fitted. Viola, thou art the daughter of that life, and wilt be
      the denizen of that world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his earlier visits he did not speak of Glyndon. The day soon came on
      which he renewed the subject. And so trustful, obedient, and entire was
      the allegiance that Viola now owned to his dominion, that, unwelcome as
      that subject was, she restrained her heart, and listened to him in
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he said, &ldquo;Thou hast promised thou wilt obey my counsels, and if,
      Viola, I should ask thee, nay adjure, to accept this stranger&rsquo;s hand, and
      share his fate, should he offer to thee such a lot,&mdash;wouldst thou
      refuse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then she pressed back the tears that gushed to her eyes; and with a
      strange pleasure in the midst of pain,&mdash;the pleasure of one who
      sacrifices heart itself to the one who commands that heart,&mdash;she
      answered falteringly, &ldquo;If thou CANST ordain it, why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dispose of me as thou wilt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanoni stood in silence for some moments: he saw the struggle which the
      girl thought she concealed so well; he made an involuntary movement
      towards her, and pressed her hand to his lips; it was the first time he
      had ever departed even so far from a certain austerity which perhaps made
      her fear him and her own thoughts the less.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Viola,&rdquo; said he, and his voice trembled, &ldquo;the danger that I can avert no
      more, if thou linger still in Naples, comes hourly near and near to thee!
      On the third day from this thy fate must be decided. I accept thy promise.
      Before the last hour of that day, come what may, I shall see thee again,
      HERE, at thine own house. Till then, farewell!&rdquo;

      When Glyndon left Viola, as recorded in the concluding chapter of the
      second division of this work, he was absorbed again in those mystical
      desires and conjectures which the haunting recollection of Zanoni always
      served to create. And as he wandered through the streets, he was scarcely
      conscious of his own movements till, in the mechanism of custom, he found
      himself in the midst of one of the noble collections of pictures which
      form the boast of those Italian cities whose glory is in the past. Thither
      he had been wont, almost daily, to repair, for the gallery contained some
      of the finest specimens of a master especially the object of his
      enthusiasm and study. There, before the works of Salvator, he had often
      paused in deep and earnest reverence. The striking characteristic of that
      artist is the &ldquo;Vigour of Will;&rdquo; void of the elevated idea of abstract
      beauty, which furnishes a model and archetype to the genius of more
      illustrious order, the singular energy of the man hews out of the rock a
      dignity of his own. His images have the majesty, not of the god, but the
      savage; utterly free, like the sublimer schools, from the common-place of
      imitation,&mdash;apart, with them, from the conventional littleness of the
      Real,&mdash;he grasps the imagination, and compels it to follow him, not
      to the heaven, but through all that is most wild and fantastic upon earth;
      a sorcery, not of the starry magian, but of the gloomy wizard,&mdash;a man
      of romance whose heart beat strongly, griping art with a hand of iron, and
      forcing it to idealise the scenes of his actual life. Before this powerful
      will, Glyndon drew back more awed and admiring than before the calmer
      beauty which rose from the soul of Raphael, like Venus from the deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, as awaking from his reverie, he stood opposite to that wild and
      magnificent gloom of Nature which frowned on him from the canvas, the very
      leaves on those gnome-like, distorted trees seemed to rustle sibylline
      secrets in his ear. Those rugged and sombre Apennines, the cataract that
      dashed between, suited, more than the actual scenes would have done, the
      mood and temper of his mind. The stern, uncouth forms at rest on the crags
      below, and dwarfed by the giant size of the Matter that reigned around
      them, impressed him with the might of Nature and the littleness of Man. As
      in genius of the more spiritual cast, the living man, and the soul that
      lives in him, are studiously made the prominent image; and the mere
      accessories of scene kept down, and cast back, as if to show that the
      exile from paradise is yet the monarch of the outward world,&mdash;so, in
      the landscapes of Salvator, the tree, the mountain, the waterfall, become
      the principal, and man himself dwindles to the accessory. The Matter seems
      to reign supreme, and its true lord to creep beneath its stupendous
      shadow. Inert matter giving interest to the immortal man, not the immortal
      man to the inert matter. A terrible philosophy in art!
    </p>
    <p>
      While something of these thoughts passed through the mind of the painter,
      he felt his arm touched, and saw Nicot by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great master,&rdquo; said Nicot, &ldquo;but I do not love the school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not love, but I am awed by it. We love the beautiful and serene, but
      we have a feeling as deep as love for the terrible and dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Nicot, thoughtfully. &ldquo;And yet that feeling is only a
      superstition. The nursery, with its tales of ghosts and goblins, is the
      cradle of many of our impressions in the world. But art should not seek to
      pander to our ignorance; art should represent only truths. I confess that
      Raphael pleases me less, because I have no sympathy with his subjects. His
      saints and virgins are to me only men and women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And from what source should painting, then, take its themes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From history, without doubt,&rdquo; returned Nicot, pragmatically,&mdash;&ldquo;those
      great Roman actions which inspire men with sentiments of liberty and
      valour, with the virtues of a republic. I wish the cartoons of Raphael had
      illustrated the story of the Horatii; but it remains for France and her
      Republic to give to posterity the new and the true school, which could
      never have arisen in a country of priestcraft and delusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the saints and virgins of Raphael are to you only men and women?&rdquo;
       repeated Glyndon, going back to Nicot&rsquo;s candid confession in amaze, and
      scarcely hearing the deductions the Frenchman drew from his proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly. Ha, ha!&rdquo; and Nicot laughed hideously, &ldquo;do you ask me to
      believe in the calendar, or what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the ideal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ideal!&rdquo; interrupted Nicot. &ldquo;Stuff! The Italian critics, and your
      English Reynolds, have turned your head. They are so fond of their &lsquo;gusto
      grande,&rsquo; and their &lsquo;ideal beauty that speaks to the soul!&lsquo;&mdash;soul!&mdash;IS
      there a soul? I understand a man when he talks of composing for a refined
      taste,&mdash;for an educated and intelligent reason; for a sense that
      comprehends truths. But as for the soul,&mdash;bah!&mdash;we are but
      modifications of matter, and painting is modification of matter also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon turned his eyes from the picture before him to Nicot, and from
      Nicot to the picture. The dogmatist gave a voice to the thoughts which the
      sight of the picture had awakened. He shook his head without reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said Nicot, abruptly, &ldquo;that imposter,&mdash;Zanoni!&mdash;oh! I
      have now learned his name and quackeries, forsooth,&mdash;what did he say
      to thee of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of thee? Nothing; but to warn me against thy doctrines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! was that all?&rdquo; said Nicot. &ldquo;He is a notable inventor, and since,
      when we met last, I unmasked his delusions, I thought he might retaliate
      by some tale of slander.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unmasked his delusions!&mdash;how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dull and long story: he wished to teach an old doting friend of mine
      his secrets of prolonged life and philosophical alchemy. I advise thee to
      renounce so discreditable an acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that Nicot nodded significantly, and, not wishing to be further
      questioned, went his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon&rsquo;s mind at that moment had escaped to his art, and the comments and
      presence of Nicot had been no welcome interruption. He turned from the
      landscape of Salvator, and his eye falling on a Nativity by Coreggio, the
      contrast between the two ranks of genius struck him as a discovery. That
      exquisite repose, that perfect sense of beauty, that strength without
      effort, that breathing moral of high art, which speaks to the mind through
      the eye, and raises the thoughts, by the aid of tenderness and love, to
      the regions of awe and wonder,&mdash;ay! THAT was the true school. He
      quitted the gallery with reluctant steps and inspired ideas; he sought his
      own home. Here, pleased not to find the sober Mervale, he leaned his face
      on his hands, and endeavoured to recall the words of Zanoni in their last
      meeting. Yes, he felt Nicot&rsquo;s talk even on art was crime; it debased the
      imagination itself to mechanism. Could he, who saw nothing in the soul but
      a combination of matter, prate of schools that should excel a Raphael?
      Yes, art was magic; and as he owned the truth of the aphorism, he could
      comprehend that in magic there may be religion, for religion is an
      essential to art. His old ambition, freeing itself from the frigid
      prudence with which Mervale sought to desecrate all images less
      substantial than the golden calf of the world, revived, and stirred, and
      kindled. The subtle detection of what he conceived to be an error in the
      school he had hitherto adopted, made more manifest to him by the grinning
      commentary of Nicot, seemed to open to him a new world of invention. He
      seized the happy moment,&mdash;he placed before him the colours and the
      canvas. Lost in his conceptions of a fresh ideal, his mind was lifted
      aloft into the airy realms of beauty; dark thoughts, unhallowed desires,
      vanished. Zanoni was right: the material world shrunk from his gaze; he
      viewed Nature as from a mountain-top afar; and as the waves of his unquiet
      heart became calm and still, again the angel eyes of Viola beamed on them
      as a holy star.
    </p>
    <p>
      Locking himself in his chamber, he refused even the visits of Mervale.
      Intoxicated with the pure air of his fresh existence, he remained for
      three days, and almost nights, absorbed in his employment; but on the
      fourth morning came that reaction to which all labour is exposed. He woke
      listless and fatigued; and as he cast his eyes on the canvas, the glory
      seemed to have gone from it. Humiliating recollections of the great
      masters he aspired to rival forced themselves upon him; defects before
      unseen magnified themselves to deformities in his languid and discontented
      eyes. He touched and retouched, but his hand failed him; he threw down his
      instruments in despair; he opened his casement: the day without was bright
      and lovely; the street was crowded with that life which is ever so joyous
      and affluent in the animated population of Naples. He saw the lover, as he
      passed, conversing with his mistress by those mute gestures which have
      survived all changes of languages, the same now as when the Etruscan
      painted yon vases in the Museo Borbonico. Light from without beckoned his
      youth to its mirth and its pleasures; and the dull walls within, lately
      large enough to comprise heaven and earth, seemed now cabined and confined
      as a felon&rsquo;s prison. He welcomed the step of Mervale at his threshold, and
      unbarred the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is that all you have done?&rdquo; said Mervale, glancing disdainfully at
      the canvas. &ldquo;Is it for this that you have shut yourself out from the sunny
      days and moonlit nights of Naples?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While the fit was on me, I basked in a brighter sun, and imbibed the
      voluptuous luxury of a softer moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You own that the fit is over. Well, that is some sign of returning sense.
      After all, it is better to daub canvas for three days than make a fool of
      yourself for life. This little siren?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be dumb! I hate to hear you name her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mervale drew his chair nearer to Glyndon&rsquo;s, thrust his hands deep in his
      breeches-pockets, stretched his legs, and was about to begin a serious
      strain of expostulation, when a knock was heard at the door, and Nicot,
      without waiting for leave, obtruded his ugly head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day, mon cher confrere. I wished to speak to you. Hein! you have
      been at work, I see. This is well,&mdash;very well! A bold outline,&mdash;great
      freedom in that right hand. But, hold! is the composition good? You have
      not got the great pyramidal form. Don&rsquo;t you think, too, that you have lost
      the advantage of contrast in this figure; since the right leg is put
      forward, surely the right arm should be put back? Peste! but that little
      finger is very fine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mervale detested Nicot. For all speculators, Utopians, alterers of the
      world, and wanderers from the high road, were equally hateful to him; but
      he could have hugged the Frenchman at that moment. He saw in Glyndon&rsquo;s
      expressive countenance all the weariness and disgust he endured. After so
      wrapped a study, to be prated to about pyramidal forms and right arms and
      right legs, the accidence of the art, the whole conception to be
      overlooked, and the criticism to end in approval of the little finger!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Glyndon, peevishly, throwing the cloth over his design, &ldquo;enough
      of my poor performance. What is it you have to say to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; said Nicot, huddling himself together upon a stool,&mdash;&ldquo;in
      the first place, this Signor Zanoni,&mdash;this second Cagliostro,&mdash;who
      disputes my doctrines! (no doubt a spy of the man Capet) I am not
      vindictive; as Helvetius says, &lsquo;our errors arise from our passions.&rsquo; I
      keep mine in order; but it is virtuous to hate in the cause of mankind; I
      would I had the denouncing and the judging of Signor Zanoni at Paris.&rdquo; And
      Nicot&rsquo;s small eyes shot fire, and he gnashed his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any new cause to hate him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Nicot, fiercely. &ldquo;Yes, I hear he is courting the girl I mean
      to marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! Whom do you speak of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The celebrated Pisani! She is divinely handsome. She would make my
      fortune in a republic. And a republic we shall have before the year is
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mervale rubbed his hands, and chuckled. Glyndon coloured with rage and
      shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the Signora Pisani? Have you ever spoken to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. But when I make up my mind to anything, it is soon done. I am
      about to return to Paris. They write me word that a handsome wife advances
      the career of a patriot. The age of prejudice is over. The sublimer
      virtues begin to be understood. I shall take back the handsomest wife in
      Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet! What are you about?&rdquo; said Mervale, seizing Glyndon as he saw
      him advance towards the Frenchman, his eyes sparkling, and his hands
      clenched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said Glyndon, between his teeth, &ldquo;you know not of whom you thus
      speak. Do you affect to suppose that Viola Pisani would accept YOU?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if she could get a better offer,&rdquo; said Mervale, looking up to the
      ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A better offer? You don&rsquo;t understand me,&rdquo; said Nicot. &ldquo;I, Jean Nicot,
      propose to marry the girl; marry her! Others may make her more liberal
      offers, but no one, I apprehend, would make one so honourable. I alone
      have pity on her friendless situation. Besides, according to the dawning
      state of things, one will always, in France, be able to get rid of a wife
      whenever one wishes. We shall have new laws of divorce. Do you imagine
      that an Italian girl&mdash;and in no country in the world are maidens, it
      seems, more chaste (though wives may console themselves with virtues more
      philosophical)&mdash;would refuse the hand of an artist for the
      settlements of a prince? No; I think better of the Pisani than you do. I
      shall hasten to introduce myself to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you all success, Monsieur Nicot,&rdquo; said Mervale, rising, and
      shaking him heartily by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon cast at them both a disdainful glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, Monsieur Nicot,&rdquo; said he, at length, constraining his lips into
      a bitter smile,&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps you may have rivals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; replied Monsieur Nicot, carelessly, kicking his
      heels together, and appearing absorbed in admiration at the size of his
      large feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I myself admire Viola Pisani.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every painter must!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may offer her marriage as well as yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be folly in you, though wisdom in me. You would not know how
      to draw profit from the speculation! Cher confrere, you have prejudices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not dare to say you would make profit from your own wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The virtuous Cato lent his wife to a friend. I love virtue, and I cannot
      do better than imitate Cato. But to be serious,&mdash;I do not fear you as
      a rival. You are good-looking, and I am ugly. But you are irresolute, and
      I decisive. While you are uttering fine phrases, I shall say, simply, &lsquo;I
      have a bon etat. Will you marry me?&rsquo; So do your worst, cher confrere. Au
      revoir, behind the scenes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Nicot rose, stretched his long arms and short legs, yawned till
      he showed all his ragged teeth from ear to ear, pressed down his cap on
      his shaggy head with an air of defiance, and casting over his left
      shoulder a glance of triumph and malice at the indignant Glyndon,
      sauntered out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mervale burst into a violent fit of laughter. &ldquo;See how your Viola is
      estimated by your friend. A fine victory, to carry her off from the
      ugliest dog between Lapland and the Calmucks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon was yet too indignant to answer, when a new visitor arrived. It
      was Zanoni himself. Mervale, on whom the appearance and aspect of this
      personage imposed a kind of reluctant deference, which he was unwilling to
      acknowledge, and still more to betray, nodded to Glyndon, and saying,
      simply, &ldquo;More when I see you again,&rdquo; left the painter and his unexpected
      visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Zanoni, lifting the cloth from the canvas, &ldquo;that you have
      not slighted the advice I gave you. Courage, young artist; this is an
      escape from the schools: this is full of the bold self-confidence of real
      genius. You had no Nicot&mdash;no Mervale&mdash;at your elbow when this
      image of true beauty was conceived!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charmed back to his art by this unlooked-for praise, Glyndon replied
      modestly, &ldquo;I thought well of my design till this morning; and then I was
      disenchanted of my happy persuasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, rather, that, unaccustomed to continuous labour, you were fatigued
      with your employment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true. Shall I confess it? I began to miss the world without. It
      seemed to me as if, while I lavished my heart and my youth upon visions of
      beauty, I was losing the beautiful realities of actual life. And I envied
      the merry fisherman, singing as he passed below my casement, and the lover
      conversing with his mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Zanoni, with an encouraging smile, &ldquo;do you blame yourself for
      the natural and necessary return to earth, in which even the most habitual
      visitor of the Heavens of Invention seeks his relaxation and repose? Man&rsquo;s
      genius is a bird that cannot be always on the wing; when the craving for
      the actual world is felt, it is a hunger that must be appeased. They who
      command best the ideal, enjoy ever most the real. See the true artist,
      when abroad in men&rsquo;s thoroughfares, ever observant, ever diving into the
      heart, ever alive to the least as to the greatest of the complicated
      truths of existence; descending to what pedants would call the trivial and
      the frivolous. From every mesh in the social web, he can disentangle a
      grace. And for him each airy gossamer floats in the gold of the sunlight.
      Know you not that around the animalcule that sports in the water there
      shines a halo, as around the star (The monas mica, found in the purest
      pools, is encompassed with a halo. And this is frequent amongst many other
      species of animalcule.) that revolves in bright pastime through the space?
      True art finds beauty everywhere. In the street, in the market-place, in
      the hovel, it gathers food for the hive of its thoughts. In the mire of
      politics, Dante and Milton selected pearls for the wreath of song.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who ever told you that Raphael did not enjoy the life without, carrying
      everywhere with him the one inward idea of beauty which attracted and
      imbedded in its own amber every straw that the feet of the dull man
      trampled into mud? As some lord of the forest wanders abroad for its prey,
      and scents and follows it over plain and hill, through brake and jungle,
      but, seizing it at last, bears the quarry to its unwitnessed cave,&mdash;so
      Genius searches through wood and waste, untiringly and eagerly, every
      sense awake, every nerve strained to speed and strength, for the scattered
      and flying images of matter, that it seizes at last with its mighty
      talons, and bears away with it into solitudes no footstep can invade. Go,
      seek the world without; it is for art the inexhaustible pasture-ground and
      harvest to the world within!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You comfort me,&rdquo; said Glyndon, brightening. &ldquo;I had imagined my weariness
      a proof of my deficiency! But not now would I speak to you of these
      labours. Pardon me, if I pass from the toil to the reward. You have
      uttered dim prophecies of my future, if I wed one who, in the judgment of
      the sober world, would only darken its prospects and obstruct its
      ambition. Do you speak from the wisdom which is experience, or that which
      aspires to prediction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they not allied? Is it not he best accustomed to calculation who can
      solve at a glance any new problem in the arithmetic of chances?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You evade my question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I will adapt my answer the better to your comprehension, for it
      is upon this very point that I have sought you. Listen to me!&rdquo; Zanoni
      fixed his eyes earnestly on his listener, and continued: &ldquo;For the
      accomplishment of whatever is great and lofty, the clear perception of
      truths is the first requisite,&mdash;truths adapted to the object desired.
      The warrior thus reduces the chances of battle to combinations almost of
      mathematics. He can predict a result, if he can but depend upon the
      materials he is forced to employ. At such a loss he can cross that bridge;
      in such a time he can reduce that fort. Still more accurately, for he
      depends less on material causes than ideas at his command, can the
      commander of the purer science or diviner art, if he once perceive the
      truths that are in him and around, foretell what he can achieve, and in
      what he is condemned to fail. But this perception of truths is disturbed
      by many causes,&mdash;vanity, passion, fear, indolence in himself,
      ignorance of the fitting means without to accomplish what he designs. He
      may miscalculate his own forces; he may have no chart of the country he
      would invade. It is only in a peculiar state of the mind that it is
      capable of perceiving truth; and that state is profound serenity. Your
      mind is fevered by a desire for truth: you would compel it to your
      embraces; you would ask me to impart to you, without ordeal or
      preparation, the grandest secrets that exist in Nature. But truth can no
      more be seen by the mind unprepared for it, than the sun can dawn upon the
      midst of night. Such a mind receives truth only to pollute it: to use the
      simile of one who has wandered near to the secret of the sublime Goetia
      (or the magic that lies within Nature, as electricity within the cloud),
      &lsquo;He who pours water into the muddy well, does but disturb the mud.&rsquo;&rdquo;
       (&ldquo;Iamb. de Vit. Pythag.&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you tend to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This: that you have faculties that may attain to surpassing power, that
      may rank you among those enchanters who, greater than the magian, leave
      behind them an enduring influence, worshipped wherever beauty is
      comprehended, wherever the soul is sensible of a higher world than that in
      which matter struggles for crude and incomplete existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to make available those faculties, need I be a prophet to tell you
      that you must learn to concentre upon great objects all your desires? The
      heart must rest, that the mind may be active. At present you wander from
      aim to aim. As the ballast to the ship, so to the spirit are faith and
      love. With your whole heart, affections, humanity, centred in one object,
      your mind and aspirations will become equally steadfast and in earnest.
      Viola is a child as yet; you do not perceive the high nature the trials of
      life will develop. Pardon me, if I say that her soul, purer and loftier
      than your own, will bear it upward, as a secret hymn carries aloft the
      spirits of the world. Your nature wants the harmony, the music which, as
      the Pythagoreans wisely taught, at once elevates and soothes. I offer you
      that music in her love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But am I sure that she does love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Artist, no; she loves you not at present; her affections are full of
      another. But if I could transfer to you, as the loadstone transfers its
      attraction to the magnet, the love that she has now for me,&mdash;if I
      could cause her to see in you the ideal of her dreams&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is such a gift in the power of man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I offer it to you, if your love be lawful, if your faith in virtue and
      yourself be deep and loyal; if not, think you that I would disenchant her
      with truth to make her adore a falsehood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if,&rdquo; persisted Glyndon,&mdash;&ldquo;if she be all that you tell me, and if
      she love you, how can you rob yourself of so priceless a treasure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, shallow and mean heart of man!&rdquo; exclaimed Zanoni, with unaccustomed
      passion and vehemence, &ldquo;dost thou conceive so little of love as not to
      know that it sacrifices all&mdash;love itself&mdash;for the happiness of
      the thing it loves? Hear me!&rdquo; And Zanoni&rsquo;s face grew pale. &ldquo;Hear me! I
      press this upon you, because I love her, and because I fear that with me
      her fate will be less fair than with yourself. Why,&mdash;ask not, for I
      will not tell you. Enough! Time presses now for your answer; it cannot
      long be delayed. Before the night of the third day from this, all choice
      will be forbid you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Glyndon, still doubting and suspicious,&mdash;&ldquo;but why this
      haste?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man, you are not worthy of her when you ask me. All I can tell you here,
      you should have known yourself. This ravisher, this man of will, this son
      of the old Visconti, unlike you,&mdash;steadfast, resolute, earnest even
      in his crimes,&mdash;never relinquishes an object. But one passion
      controls his lust,&mdash;it is his avarice. The day after his attempt on
      Viola, his uncle, the Cardinal &mdash;, from whom he has large
      expectations of land and gold, sent for him, and forbade him, on pain of
      forfeiting all the possessions which his schemes already had parcelled
      out, to pursue with dishonourable designs one whom the Cardinal had heeded
      and loved from childhood. This is the cause of his present pause from his
      pursuit. While we speak, the cause expires. Before the hand of the clock
      reaches the hour of noon, the Cardinal &mdash; will be no more. At this
      very moment thy friend, Jean Nicot, is with the Prince di &mdash;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He! wherefore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To ask what dower shall go with Viola Pisani, the morning that she leaves
      the palace of the prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how do you know all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool! I tell thee again, because a lover is a watcher by night and day;
      because love never sleeps when danger menaces the beloved one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you it was that informed the Cardinal &mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and what has been my task might as easily have been thine. Speak,&mdash;thine
      answer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have it on the third day from this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so. Put off, poor waverer, thy happiness to the last hour. On the
      third day from this, I will ask thee thy resolve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where shall we meet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before midnight, where you may least expect me. You cannot shun me,
      though you may seek to do so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay one moment! You condemn me as doubtful, irresolute, suspicious. Have
      I no cause? Can I yield without a struggle to the strange fascination you
      exert upon my mind? What interest can you have in me, a stranger, that you
      should thus dictate to me the gravest action in the life of man? Do you
      suppose that any one in his senses would not pause, and deliberate, and
      ask himself, &lsquo;Why should this stranger care thus for me?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Zanoni, &ldquo;if I told thee that I could initiate thee into
      the secrets of that magic which the philosophy of the whole existing world
      treats as a chimera, or imposture; if I promised to show thee how to
      command the beings of air and ocean, how to accumulate wealth more easily
      than a child can gather pebbles on the shore, to place in thy hands the
      essence of the herbs which prolong life from age to age, the mystery of
      that attraction by which to awe all danger and disarm all violence and
      subdue man as the serpent charms the bird,&mdash;if I told thee that all
      these it was mine to possess and to communicate, thou wouldst listen to me
      then, and obey me without a doubt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true; and I can account for this only by the imperfect associations
      of my childhood,&mdash;by traditions in our house of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your forefather, who, in the revival of science, sought the secrets of
      Apollonius and Paracelsus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Glyndon, amazed, &ldquo;are you so well acquainted with the annals
      of an obscure lineage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the man who aspires to know, no man who has been the meanest student
      of knowledge should be unknown. You ask me why I have shown this interest
      in your fate? There is one reason which I have not yet told you. There is
      a fraternity as to whose laws and whose mysteries the most inquisitive
      schoolmen are in the dark. By those laws all are pledged to warn, to aid,
      and to guide even the remotest descendants of men who have toiled, though
      vainly, like your ancestor, in the mysteries of the Order. We are bound to
      advise them to their welfare; nay, more,&mdash;if they command us to it,
      we must accept them as our pupils. I am a survivor of that most ancient
      and immemorial union. This it was that bound me to thee at the first;
      this, perhaps, attracted thyself unconsciously, Son of our Brotherhood, to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this be so, I command thee, in the name of the laws thou obeyest, to
      receive me as thy pupil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you ask?&rdquo; said Zanoni, passionately. &ldquo;Learn, first, the
      conditions. No neophyte must have, at his initiation, one affection or
      desire that chains him to the world. He must be pure from the love of
      woman, free from avarice and ambition, free from the dreams even of art,
      or the hope of earthly fame. The first sacrifice thou must make is&mdash;Viola
      herself. And for what? For an ordeal that the most daring courage only can
      encounter, the most ethereal natures alone survive! Thou art unfit for the
      science that has made me and others what we are or have been; for thy
      whole nature is one fear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear!&rdquo; cried Glyndon, colouring with resentment, and rising to the full
      height of his stature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear! and the worst fear,&mdash;fear of the world&rsquo;s opinion; fear of the
      Nicots and the Mervales; fear of thine own impulses when most generous;
      fear of thine own powers when thy genius is most bold; fear that virtue is
      not eternal; fear that God does not live in heaven to keep watch on earth;
      fear, the fear of little men; and that fear is never known to the great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words Zanoni abruptly left the artist, humbled, bewildered, and
      not convinced. He remained alone with his thoughts till he was aroused by
      the striking of the clock; he then suddenly remembered Zanoni&rsquo;s prediction
      of the Cardinal&rsquo;s death; and, seized with an intense desire to learn its
      truth, he hurried into the streets,&mdash;he gained the Cardinal&rsquo;s palace.
      Five minutes before noon his Eminence had expired, after an illness of
      less than an hour. Zanoni&rsquo;s visit had occupied more time than the illness
      of the Cardinal. Awed and perplexed, he turned from the palace, and as he
      walked through the Chiaja, he saw Jean Nicot emerge from the portals of
      the Prince di &mdash;.

      Venerable Brotherhood, so sacred and so little known, from whose secret
      and precious archives the materials for this history have been drawn; ye
      who have retained, from century to century, all that time has spared of
      the august and venerable science,&mdash;thanks to you, if now, for the
      first time, some record of the thoughts and actions of no false and
      self-styled luminary of your Order be given, however imperfectly, to the
      world. Many have called themselves of your band; many spurious pretenders
      have been so-called by the learned ignorance which still, baffled and
      perplexed, is driven to confess that it knows nothing of your origin, your
      ceremonies or doctrines, nor even if you still have local habitation on
      the earth. Thanks to you if I, the only one of my country, in this age,
      admitted, with a profane footstep, into your mysterious Academe (The
      reader will have the goodness to remember that this is said by the author
      of the original MS., not by the editor.), have been by you empowered and
      instructed to adapt to the comprehension of the uninitiated, some few of
      the starry truths which shone on the great Shemaia of the Chaldean Lore,
      and gleamed dimly through the darkened knowledge of latter disciples,
      labouring, like Psellus and Iamblichus, to revive the embers of the fire
      which burned in the Hamarin of the East. Though not to us of an aged and
      hoary world is vouchsafed the NAME which, so say the earliest oracles of
      the earth, &ldquo;rushes into the infinite worlds,&rdquo; yet is it ours to trace the
      reviving truths, through each new discovery of the philosopher and
      chemist. The laws of attraction, of electricity, and of the yet more
      mysterious agency of that great principal of life, which, if drawn from
      the universe, would leave the universe a grave, were but the code in which
      the Theurgy of old sought the guides that led it to a legislation and
      science of its own. To rebuild on words the fragments of this history, it
      seems to me as if, in a solemn trance, I was led through the ruins of a
      city whose only remains were tombs. From the sarcophagus and the urn I
      awake the genius (The Greek Genius of Death.) of the extinguished Torch,
      and so closely does its shape resemble Eros, that at moments I scarcely
      know which of ye dictates to me,&mdash;O Love! O Death!
    </p>
    <p>
      And it stirred in the virgin&rsquo;s heart,&mdash;this new, unfathomable, and
      divine emotion! Was it only the ordinary affection of the pulse and the
      fancy, of the eye to the Beautiful, of the ear to the Eloquent, or did it
      not justify the notion she herself conceived of it,&mdash;that it was born
      not of the senses, that it was less of earthly and human love than the
      effect of some wondrous but not unholy charm? I said that, from that day
      in which, no longer with awe and trembling, she surrendered herself to the
      influence of Zanoni, she had sought to put her thoughts into words. Let
      the thoughts attest their own nature.

      THE SELF CONFESSIONAL.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it the daylight that shines on me, or the memory of thy presence?
      Wherever I look, the world seems full of thee; in every ray that trembles
      on the water, that smiles upon the leaves, I behold but a likeness to
      thine eyes. What is this change, that alters not only myself, but the face
      of the whole universe?
    </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How instantaneously leaped into life the power with which thou swayest my
      heart in its ebb and flow. Thousands were around me, and I saw but thee.
      That was the night in which I first entered upon the world which crowds
      life into a drama, and has no language but music. How strangely and how
      suddenly with thee became that world evermore connected! What the delusion
      of the stage was to others, thy presence was to me. My life, too, seemed
      to centre into those short hours, and from thy lips I heard a music, mute
      to all ears but mine. I sit in the room where my father dwelt. Here, on
      that happy night, forgetting why THEY were so happy, I shrunk into the
      shadow, and sought to guess what thou wert to me; and my mother&rsquo;s low
      voice woke me, and I crept to my father&rsquo;s side, close&mdash;close, from
      fear of my own thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! sweet and sad was the morrow to that night, when thy lips warned me
      of the future. An orphan now,&mdash;what is there that lives for me to
      think of, to dream upon, to revere, but thou!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How tenderly thou hast rebuked me for the grievous wrong that my thoughts
      did thee! Why should I have shuddered to feel thee glancing upon my
      thoughts like the beam on the solitary tree, to which thou didst once
      liken me so well? It was&mdash;it was, that, like the tree, I struggled
      for the light, and the light came. They tell me of love, and my very life
      of the stage breathes the language of love into my lips. No; again and
      again, I know THAT is not the love that I feel for thee!&mdash;it is not a
      passion, it is a thought! I ask not to be loved again. I murmur not that
      thy words are stern and thy looks are cold. I ask not if I have rivals; I
      sigh not to be fair in thine eyes. It is my SPIRIT that would blend itself
      with thine. I would give worlds, though we were apart, though oceans
      rolled between us, to know the hour in which thy gaze was lifted to the
      stars,&mdash;in which thy heart poured itself in prayer. They tell me thou
      art more beautiful than the marble images that are fairer than all human
      forms; but I have never dared to gaze steadfastly on thy face, that memory
      might compare thee with the rest. Only thine eyes and thy soft, calm smile
      haunt me; as when I look upon the moon, all that passes into my heart is
      her silent light.
    </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Often, when the air is calm, I have thought that I hear the strains of my
      father&rsquo;s music; often, though long stilled in the grave, have they waked
      me from the dreams of the solemn night. Methinks, ere thou comest to me
      that I hear them herald thy approach. Methinks I hear them wail and moan,
      when I sink back into myself on seeing thee depart. Thou art OF that
      music,&mdash;its spirit, its genius. My father must have guessed at thee
      and thy native regions, when the winds hushed to listen to his tones, and
      the world deemed him mad! I hear where I sit, the far murmur of the sea.
      Murmur on, ye blessed waters! The waves are the pulses of the shore. They
      beat with the gladness of the morning wind,&mdash;so beats my heart in the
      freshness and light that make up the thoughts of thee!

    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Often in my childhood I have mused and asked for what I was born; and my
      soul answered my heart and said, &lsquo;THOU WERT BORN TO WORSHIP!&rsquo; Yes; I know
      why the real world has ever seemed to me so false and cold. I know why the
      world of the stage charmed and dazzled me. I know why it was so sweet to
      sit apart and gaze my whole being into the distant heavens. My nature is
      not formed for this life, happy though that life seem to others. It is its
      very want to have ever before it some image loftier than itself! Stranger,
      in what realm above, when the grave is past, shall my soul, hour after
      hour, worship at the same source as thine?

      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the gardens of my neighbour there is a small fountain. I stood by it
      this morning after sunrise. How it sprung up, with its eager spray, to the
      sunbeams! And then I thought that I should see thee again this day, and so
      sprung my heart to the new morning which thou bringest me from the skies.
    </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I HAVE seen, I have LISTENED to thee again. How bold I have become! I ran
      on with my childlike thoughts and stories, my recollections of the past,
      as if I had known thee from an infant. Suddenly the idea of my presumption
      struck me. I stopped, and timidly sought thine eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, and when you found that the nightingale refused to sing?&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;what to thee this history of the heart of a child?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Viola,&rsquo; didst thou answer, with that voice, so inexpressibly calm and
      earnest!&mdash;&lsquo;Viola, the darkness of a child&rsquo;s heart is often but
      the shadow of a star. Speak on! And thy nightingale, when they caught and
      caged it, refused to sing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And I placed the cage yonder, amidst the vine-leaves, and took up my
      lute, and spoke to it on the strings; for I thought that all music was its
      native language, and it would understand that I sought to comfort it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; saidst thou. &lsquo;And at last it answered thee, but not with song,&mdash;in
      a sharp, brief cry; so mournful, that thy hands let fall the lute, and the
      tears gushed from thine eyes. So softly didst thou unbar the cage, and the
      nightingale flew into yonder thicket; and thou heardst the foliage rustle,
      and, looking through the moonlight, thine eyes saw that it had found its
      mate. It sang to thee then from the boughs a long, loud, joyous jubilee.
      And musing, thou didst feel that it was not the vine-leaves or the
      moonlight that made the bird give melody to night, and that the secret of
      its music was the presence of a thing beloved.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How didst thou know my thoughts in that childlike time better than I knew
      myself! How is the humble life of my past years, with its mean events, so
      mysteriously familiar to thee, bright stranger! I wonder,&mdash;but I do
      not again dare to fear thee!
    </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once the thought of him oppressed and weighed me down. As an infant that
      longs for the moon, my being was one vague desire for something never to
      be attained. Now I feel rather as if to think of thee sufficed to remove
      every fetter from my spirit. I float in the still seas of light, and
      nothing seems too high for my wings, too glorious for my eyes. It was mine
      ignorance that made me fear thee. A knowledge that is not in books seems
      to breathe around thee as an atmosphere. How little have I read!&mdash;how
      little have I learned! Yet when thou art by my side, it seems as if the
      veil were lifted from all wisdom and all Nature. I startle when I look
      even at the words I have written; they seem not to come from myself, but
      are the signs of another language which thou hast taught my heart, and
      which my hand traces rapidly, as at thy dictation. Sometimes, while I
      write or muse, I could fancy that I heard light wings hovering around me,
      and saw dim shapes of beauty floating round, and vanishing as they smiled
      upon me. No unquiet and fearful dream ever comes to me now in sleep, yet
      sleep and waking are alike but as one dream. In sleep I wander with thee,
      not through the paths of earth, but through impalpable air&mdash;an air
      which seems a music&mdash;upward and upward, as the soul mounts on the
      tones of a lyre! Till I knew thee, I was as a slave to the earth. Thou
      hast given to me the liberty of the universe! Before, it was life; it
      seems to me now as if I had commenced eternity!
    </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Formerly, when I was to appear upon the stage, my heart beat more loudly.
      I trembled to encounter the audience, whose breath gave shame or renown;
      and now I have no fear of them. I see them, heed them, hear them not! I
      know that there will be music in my voice, for it is a hymn that I pour to
      thee. Thou never comest to the theatre; and that no longer grieves me.
      Thou art become too sacred to appear a part of the common world, and I
      feel glad that thou art not by when crowds have a right to judge me.
    </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he spoke to me of ANOTHER: to another he would consign me! No, it is
      not love that I feel for thee, Zanoni; or why did I hear thee without
      anger, why did thy command seem to me not a thing impossible? As the
      strings of the instrument obey the hand of the master, thy look modulates
      the wildest chords of my heart to thy will. If it please thee,&mdash;yes,
      let it be so. Thou art lord of my destinies; they cannot rebel against
      thee! I almost think I could love him, whoever it be, on whom thou wouldst
      shed the rays that circumfuse thyself. Whatever thou hast touched, I love;
      whatever thou speakest of, I love. Thy hand played with these vine leaves;
      I wear them in my bosom. Thou seemest to me the source of all love; too
      high and too bright to be loved thyself, but darting light into other
      objects, on which the eye can gaze less dazzled. No, no; it is not love
      that I feel for thee, and therefore it is that I do not blush to nourish
      and confess it. Shame on me if I loved, knowing myself so worthless a
      thing to thee!
    </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ANOTHER!&mdash;my memory echoes back that word. Another! Dost thou mean
      that I shall see thee no more? It is not sadness,&mdash;it is not despair
      that seizes me. I cannot weep. It is an utter sense of desolation. I am
      plunged back into the common life; and I shudder coldly at the solitude.
      But I will obey thee, if thou wilt. Shall I not see thee again beyond the
      grave? O how sweet it were to die!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do I not struggle from the web in which my will is thus entangled?
      Hast thou a right to dispose of me thus? Give me back&mdash;give me back
      the life I knew before I gave life itself away to thee. Give me back the
      careless dreams of my youth,&mdash;-my liberty of heart that sung aloud as
      it walked the earth. Thou hast disenchanted me of everything that is not
      of thyself. Where was the sin, at least, to think of thee,&mdash;to see
      thee? Thy kiss still glows upon my hand; is that hand mine to bestow? Thy
      kiss claimed and hallowed it to thyself. Stranger, I will NOT obey thee.
    </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another day,&mdash;one day of the fatal three is gone! It is strange to
      me that since the sleep of the last night, a deep calm has settled upon my
      breast. I feel so assured that my very being is become a part of thee,
      that I cannot believe that my life can be separated from thine; and in
      this conviction I repose, and smile even at thy words and my own fears.
      Thou art fond of one maxim, which thou repeatest in a thousand forms,&mdash;that
      the beauty of the soul is faith; that as ideal loveliness to the sculptor,
      faith is to the heart; that faith, rightly understood, extends over all
      the works of the Creator, whom we can know but through belief; that it
      embraces a tranquil confidence in ourselves, and a serene repose as to our
      future; that it is the moonlight that sways the tides of the human sea.
      That faith I comprehend now. I reject all doubt, all fear. I know that I
      have inextricably linked the whole that makes the inner life to thee; and
      thou canst not tear me from thee, if thou wouldst! And this change from
      struggle into calm came to me with sleep,&mdash;a sleep without a dream;
      but when I woke, it was with a mysterious sense of happiness,&mdash;an
      indistinct memory of something blessed,&mdash;as if thou hadst cast from
      afar off a smile upon my slumber. At night I was so sad; not a blossom
      that had not closed itself up, as if never more to open to the sun; and
      the night itself, in the heart as on the earth, has ripened the blossoms
      into flowers. The world is beautiful once more, but beautiful in repose,&mdash;not
      a breeze stirs thy tree, not a doubt my soul!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER 3.VI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Tu vegga o per violenzia o per inganno
     Patire o disonore o mortal danno.
     &ldquo;Orlando Furioso,&rdquo; Cant. xlii. i.

     (Thou art about, either through violence or artifice, to suffer
     either dishonour or mortal loss.)
</pre>
    <p>
      It was a small cabinet; the walls were covered with pictures, one of which
      was worth more than the whole lineage of the owner of the palace. Oh, yes!
      Zanoni was right. The painter IS a magician; the gold he at least wrings
      from his crucible is no delusion. A Venetian noble might be a fribble, or
      an assassin,&mdash;a scoundrel, or a dolt; worthless, or worse than
      worthless, yet he might have sat to Titian, and his portrait may be
      inestimable,&mdash;a few inches of painted canvas a thousand times more
      valuable than a man with his veins and muscles, brain, will, heart, and
      intellect!
    </p>
    <p>
      In this cabinet sat a man of about three-and-forty,&mdash;dark-eyed,
      sallow, with short, prominent features, a massive conformation of jaw, and
      thick, sensual, but resolute lips; this man was the Prince di &mdash;. His
      form, above the middle height, and rather inclined to corpulence, was clad
      in a loose dressing-robe of rich brocade. On a table before him lay an
      old-fashioned sword and hat, a mask, dice and dice-box, a portfolio, and
      an inkstand of silver curiously carved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mascari,&rdquo; said the prince, looking up towards his parasite, who
      stood by the embrasure of the deep-set barricadoed window,&mdash;&ldquo;well!
      the Cardinal sleeps with his fathers. I require comfort for the loss of so
      excellent a relation; and where a more dulcet voice than Viola Pisani&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your Excellency serious? So soon after the death of his Eminence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be the less talked of, and I the less suspected. Hast thou
      ascertained the name of the insolent who baffled us that night, and
      advised the Cardinal the next day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sapient Mascari! I will inform thee. It was the strange Unknown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Signor Zanoni! Are you sure, my prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mascari, yes. There is a tone in that man&rsquo;s voice that I never can
      mistake; so clear, and so commanding, when I hear it I almost fancy there
      is such a thing as conscience. However, we must rid ourselves of an
      impertinent. Mascari, Signor Zanoni hath not yet honoured our poor house
      with his presence. He is a distinguished stranger,&mdash;we must give a
      banquet in his honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, and the Cyprus wine! The cypress is a proper emblem of the grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this anon. I am superstitious; there are strange stories of Zanoni&rsquo;s
      power and foresight; remember the death of Ughelli. No matter, though the
      Fiend were his ally, he should not rob me of my prize; no, nor my
      revenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Excellency is infatuated; the actress has bewitched you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mascari,&rdquo; said the prince, with a haughty smile, &ldquo;through these veins
      rolls the blood of the old Visconti&mdash;of those who boasted that no
      woman ever escaped their lust, and no man their resentment. The crown of
      my fathers has shrunk into a gewgaw and a toy,&mdash;their ambition and
      their spirit are undecayed! My honour is now enlisted in this pursuit,&mdash;Viola
      must be mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another ambuscade?&rdquo; said Mascari, inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, why not enter the house itself?&mdash;the situation is lonely, and
      the door is not made of iron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what if, on her return home, she tell the tale of our violence? A
      house forced,&mdash;a virgin stolen! Reflect; though the feudal privileges
      are not destroyed, even a Visconti is not now above the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he not, Mascari? Fool! in what age of the world, even if the Madmen of
      France succeed in their chimeras, will the iron of law not bend itself,
      like an osier twig, to the strong hand of power and gold? But look not so
      pale, Mascari; I have foreplanned all things. The day that she leaves this
      palace, she will leave it for France, with Monsieur Jean Nicot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Mascari could reply, the gentleman of the chamber announced the
      Signor Zanoni.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince involuntarily laid his hand upon the sword placed on the table,
      then with a smile at his own impulse, rose, and met his visitor at the
      threshold, with all the profuse and respectful courtesy of Italian
      simulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is an honour highly prized,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;I have long desired
      to clasp the hand of one so distinguished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I give it in the spirit with which you seek it,&rdquo; replied Zanoni.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Neapolitan bowed over the hand he pressed; but as he touched it a
      shiver came over him, and his heart stood still. Zanoni bent on him his
      dark, smiling eyes, and then seated himself with a familiar air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus it is signed and sealed; I mean our friendship, noble prince. And
      now I will tell you the object of my visit. I find, Excellency, that,
      unconsciously perhaps, we are rivals. Can we not accommodate out
      pretensions!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the prince, carelessly, &ldquo;you, then, were the cavalier who
      robbed me of the reward of my chase. All stratagems fair in love, as in
      war. Reconcile our pretensions! Well, here is the dice-box; let us throw
      for her. He who casts the lowest shall resign his claim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this a decision by which you will promise to be bound?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, on my faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for him who breaks his word so plighted, what shall be the forfeit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sword lies next to the dice-box, Signor Zanoni. Let him who stands
      not by his honour fall by the sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you invoke that sentence if either of us fail his word? Be it so; let
      Signor Mascari cast for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well said!&mdash;Mascari, the dice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince threw himself back in his chair; and, world-hardened as he was,
      could not suppress the glow of triumph and satisfaction that spread itself
      over his features. Mascari took up the three dice, and rattled them
      noisily in the box. Zanoni, leaning his cheek on his hand, and bending
      over the table, fixed his eyes steadfastly on the parasite; Mascari in
      vain struggled to extricate from that searching gaze; he grew pale, and
      trembled, he put down the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give the first throw to your Excellency. Signor Mascari, be pleased to
      terminate our suspense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Mascari took up the box; again his hand shook so that the dice
      rattled within. He threw; the numbers were sixteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a high throw,&rdquo; said Zanoni, calmly; &ldquo;nevertheless, Signor Mascari,
      I do not despond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mascari gathered up the dice, shook the box, and rolled the contents once
      more on the table: the number was the highest that can be thrown,&mdash;eighteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince darted a glance of fire at his minion, who stood with gaping
      mouth, staring at the dice, and trembling from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have won, you see,&rdquo; said Zanoni; &ldquo;may we be friends still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signor,&rdquo; said the prince, obviously struggling with anger and confusion,
      &ldquo;the victory is yours. But pardon me, you have spoken lightly of this
      young girl,&mdash;will anything tempt you to yield your claim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, do not think so ill of my gallantry; and,&rdquo; resumed Zanoni, with a
      stern meaning in his voice, &ldquo;forget not the forfeit your own lips have
      named.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince knit his brow, but constrained the haughty answer that was his
      first impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; he said, forcing a smile; &ldquo;I yield. Let me prove that I do not
      yield ungraciously; will you favour me with your presence at a little
      feast I propose to give in honour,&rdquo; he added, with a sardonic mockery, &ldquo;of
      the elevation of my kinsman, the late Cardinal, of pious memory, to the
      true seat of St. Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, indeed, a happiness to hear one command of yours I can obey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanoni then turned the conversation, talked lightly and gayly, and soon
      afterwards departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Villain!&rdquo; then exclaimed the prince, grasping Mascari by the collar, &ldquo;you
      betrayed me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure your Excellency that the dice were properly arranged; he should
      have thrown twelve; but he is the Devil, and that&rsquo;s the end of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no time to be lost,&rdquo; said the prince, quitting his hold of his
      parasite, who quietly resettled his cravat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My blood is up,&mdash;I will win this girl, if I die for it! What noise
      is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is but the sword of your illustrious ancestor that has fallen from the
      table.&rdquo;

      Letter from Zanoni to Mejnour.
    </p>
    <p>
      My art is already dim and troubled. I have lost the tranquillity which is
      power. I cannot influence the decisions of those whom I would most guide
      to the shore; I see them wander farther and deeper into the infinite ocean
      where our barks sail evermore to the horizon that flies before us! Amazed
      and awed to find that I can only warn where I would control, I have looked
      into my own soul. It is true that the desires of earth chain me to the
      present, and shut me from the solemn secrets which Intellect, purified
      from all the dross of the clay, alone can examine and survey. The stern
      condition on which we hold our nobler and diviner gifts darkens our vision
      towards the future of those for whom we know the human infirmities of
      jealousy or hate or love. Mejnour, all around me is mist and haze; I have
      gone back in our sublime existence; and from the bosom of the imperishable
      youth that blooms only in the spirit, springs up the dark poison-flower of
      human love.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man is not worthy of her,&mdash;I know that truth; yet in his nature
      are the seeds of good and greatness, if the tares and weeds of worldly
      vanities and fears would suffer them to grow. If she were his, and I had
      thus transplanted to another soil the passion that obscures my gaze and
      disarms my power, unseen, unheard, unrecognised, I could watch over his
      fate, and secretly prompt his deeds, and minister to her welfare through
      his own. But time rushes on! Through the shadows that encircle me, I see,
      gathering round her, the darkest dangers. No choice but flight,&mdash;no
      escape save with him or me. With me!&mdash;the rapturous thought,&mdash;the
      terrible conviction! With me! Mejnour, canst thou wonder that I would save
      her from myself? A moment in the life of ages,&mdash;a bubble on the
      shoreless sea. What else to me can be human love? And in this exquisite
      nature of hers,&mdash;more pure, more spiritual, even in its young
      affections than ever heretofore the countless volumes of the heart, race
      after race, have given to my gaze: there is yet a deep-buried feeling that
      warns me of inevitable woe. Thou austere and remorseless Hierophant,&mdash;thou
      who hast sought to convert to our brotherhood every spirit that seemed to
      thee most high and bold,&mdash;even thou knowest, by horrible experience,
      how vain the hope to banish FEAR from the heart of woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      My life would be to her one marvel. Even if, on the other hand, I sought
      to guide her path through the realms of terror to the light, think of the
      Haunter of the Threshold, and shudder with me at the awful hazard! I have
      endeavoured to fill the Englishman&rsquo;s ambition with the true glory of his
      art; but the restless spirit of his ancestor still seems to whisper in
      him, and to attract to the spheres in which it lost its own wandering way.
      There is a mystery in man&rsquo;s inheritance from his fathers. Peculiarities of
      the mind, as diseases of the body, rest dormant for generations, to revive
      in some distant descendant, baffle all treatment and elude all skill. Come
      to me from thy solitude amidst the wrecks of Rome! I pant for a living
      confidant,&mdash;for one who in the old time has himself known jealousy
      and love. I have sought commune with Adon-Ai; but his presence, that once
      inspired such heavenly content with knowledge, and so serene a confidence
      in destiny, now only troubles and perplexes me. From the height from which
      I strive to search into the shadows of things to come, I see confused
      spectres of menace and wrath. Methinks I behold a ghastly limit to the
      wondrous existence I have held,&mdash;methinks that, after ages of the
      Ideal Life, I see my course merge into the most stormy whirlpool of the
      Real. Where the stars opened to me their gates, there looms a scaffold,&mdash;thick
      steams of blood rise as from a shambles. What is more strange to me, a
      creature here, a very type of the false ideal of common men,&mdash;body
      and mind, a hideous mockery of the art that shapes the Beautiful, and the
      desires that seek the Perfect, ever haunts my vision amidst these
      perturbed and broken clouds of the fate to be. By that shadowy scaffold it
      stands and gibbers at me, with lips dropping slime and gore. Come, O
      friend of the far-time; for me, at least, thy wisdom has not purged away
      thy human affections. According to the bonds of our solemn order, reduced
      now to thee and myself, lone survivors of so many haughty and glorious
      aspirants, thou art pledged, too, to warn the descendant of those whom thy
      counsels sought to initiate into the great secret in a former age. The
      last of that bold Visconti who was once thy pupil is the relentless
      persecutor of this fair child. With thoughts of lust and murder, he is
      digging his own grave; thou mayest yet daunt him from his doom. And I also
      mysteriously, by the same bond, am pledged to obey, if he so command, a
      less guilty descendant of a baffled but nobler student. If he reject my
      counsel, and insist upon the pledge, Mejnour, thou wilt have another
      neophyte. Beware of another victim! Come to me! This will reach thee with
      all speed. Answer it by the pressure of one hand that I can dare to clasp!

      At Naples, the tomb of Virgil, beetling over the cave of Posilipo, is
      reverenced, not with the feelings that should hallow the memory of the
      poet, but the awe that wraps the memory of the magician. To his charms
      they ascribe the hollowing of that mountain passage; and tradition yet
      guards his tomb by the spirits he had raised to construct the cavern. This
      spot, in the immediate vicinity of Viola&rsquo;s home, had often attracted her
      solitary footsteps. She had loved the dim and solemn fancies that beset
      her as she looked into the lengthened gloom of the grotto, or, ascending
      to the tomb, gazed from the rock on the dwarfed figures of the busy crowd
      that seemed to creep like insects along the windings of the soil below;
      and now, at noon, she bent thither her thoughtful way. She threaded the
      narrow path, she passed the gloomy vineyard that clambers up the rock, and
      gained the lofty spot, green with moss and luxuriant foliage, where the
      dust of him who yet soothes and elevates the minds of men is believed to
      rest. From afar rose the huge fortress of St. Elmo, frowning darkly amidst
      spires and domes that glittered in the sun. Lulled in its azure splendour
      lay the Siren&rsquo;s sea; and the grey smoke of Vesuvius, in the clear
      distance, soared like a moving pillar into the lucid sky. Motionless on
      the brink of the precipice, Viola looked upon the lovely and living world
      that stretched below; and the sullen vapour of Vesuvius fascinated her eye
      yet more than the scattered gardens, or the gleaming Caprea, smiling
      amidst the smiles of the sea. She heard not a step that had followed her
      on her path and started to hear a voice at hand. So sudden was the
      apparition of the form that stood by her side, emerging from the bushes
      that clad the crags, and so singularly did it harmonise in its uncouth
      ugliness with the wild nature of the scene immediately around her, and the
      wizard traditions of the place, that the colour left her cheek, and a
      faint cry broke from her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tush, pretty trembler!&mdash;do not be frightened at my face,&rdquo; said the
      man, with a bitter smile. &ldquo;After three months&rsquo; marriage, there is no
      different between ugliness and beauty. Custom is a great leveller. I was
      coming to your house when I saw you leave it; so, as I have matters of
      importance to communicate, I ventured to follow your footsteps. My name is
      Jean Nicot, a name already favourably known as a French artist. The art of
      painting and the art of music are nearly connected, and the stage is an
      altar that unites the two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something frank and unembarrassed in the man&rsquo;s address that
      served to dispel the fear his appearance had occasioned. He seated
      himself, as he spoke, on a crag beside her, and, looking up steadily into
      her face, continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very beautiful, Viola Pisani, and I am not surprised at the
      number of your admirers. If I presume to place myself in the list, it is
      because I am the only one who loves thee honestly, and woos thee fairly.
      Nay, look not so indignant! Listen to me. Has the Prince di &mdash; ever
      spoken to thee of marriage; or the beautiful imposter Zanoni, or the young
      blue-eyed Englishman, Clarence Glyndon? It is marriage,&mdash;it is a
      home, it is safety, it is reputation, that I offer to thee; and these last
      when the straight form grows crooked, and the bright eyes dim. What say
      you?&rdquo; and he attempted to seize her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viola shrunk from him, and silently turned to depart. He rose abruptly and
      placed himself on her path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Actress, you must hear me! Do you know what this calling of the stage is
      in the eyes of prejudice,&mdash;that is, of the common opinion of mankind?
      It is to be a princess before the lamps, and a Pariah before the day. No
      man believes in your virtue, no man credits your vows; you are the puppet
      that they consent to trick out with tinsel for their amusement, not an
      idol for their worship. Are you so enamoured of this career that you scorn
      even to think of security and honour? Perhaps you are different from what
      you seem. Perhaps you laugh at the prejudice that would degrade you, and
      would wisely turn it to advantage. Speak frankly to me; I have no
      prejudice either. Sweet one, I am sure we should agree. Now, this Prince
      di &mdash;, I have a message from him. Shall I deliver it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Never had Viola felt as she felt then, never had she so thoroughly seen
      all the perils of her forelorn condition and her fearful renown. Nicot
      continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zanoni would but amuse himself with thy vanity; Glyndon would despise
      himself, if he offered thee his name, and thee, if thou wouldst accept it;
      but the Prince di &mdash; is in earnest, and he is wealthy. Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Nicot approached his lips to her, and hissed a sentence which she did
      not suffer him to complete. She darted from him with one glance of
      unutterable disdain. As he strove to regain his hold of her arm, he lost
      his footing, and fell down the sides of the rock till, bruised and
      lacerated, a pine-branch saved him from the yawning abyss below. She heard
      his exclamation of rage and pain as she bounded down the path, and,
      without once turning to look behind, regained her home. By the porch stood
      Glyndon, conversing with Gionetta. She passed him abruptly, entered the
      house, and, sinking on the floor, wept loud and passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon, who had followed her in surprise, vainly sought to soothe and
      calm her. She would not reply to his questions; she did not seem to listen
      to his protestations of love, till suddenly, as Nicot&rsquo;s terrible picture
      of the world&rsquo;s judgment of that profession which to her younger thoughts
      had seemed the service of Song and the Beautiful, forced itself upon her,
      she raised her face from her hands, and, looking steadily upon the
      Englishman, said, &ldquo;False one, dost thou talk of me of love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my honour, words fail to tell thee how I love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilt thou give me thy home, thy name? Dost thou woo me as thy wife?&rdquo; And
      at that moment, had Glyndon answered as his better angel would have
      counselled, perhaps, in that revolution of her whole mind which the words
      of Nicot had effected, which made her despise her very self, sicken of her
      lofty dreams, despair of the future, and distrust her whole ideal,&mdash;perhaps,
      I say, in restoring her self-esteem,&mdash;he would have won her
      confidence, and ultimately secured her love. But against the prompting of
      his nobler nature rose up at that sudden question all those doubts which,
      as Zanoni had so well implied, made the true enemies of his soul. Was he
      thus suddenly to be entangled into a snare laid for his credulity by
      deceivers? Was she not instructed to seize the moment to force him into an
      avowal which prudence must repent? Was not the great actress rehearsing a
      premeditated part? He turned round, as these thoughts, the children of the
      world, passed across him, for he literally fancied that he heard the
      sarcastic laugh of Mervale without. Nor was he deceived. Mervale was
      passing by the threshold, and Gionetta had told him his friend was within.
      Who does not know the effect of the world&rsquo;s laugh? Mervale was the
      personation of the world. The whole world seemed to shout derision in
      those ringing tones. He drew back,&mdash;he recoiled. Viola followed him
      with her earnest, impatient eyes. At last, he faltered forth, &ldquo;Do all of
      thy profession, beautiful Viola, exact marriage as the sole condition of
      love?&rdquo; Oh, bitter question! Oh, poisoned taunt! He repented it the moment
      after. He was seized with remorse of reason, of feeling, and of
      conscience. He saw her form shrink, as it were, at his cruel words. He saw
      the colour come and go, to leave the writhing lips like marble; and then,
      with a sad, gentle look of self-pity, rather than reproach, she pressed
      her hands tightly to her bosom, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was right! Pardon me, Englishman; I see now, indeed, that I am the
      Pariah and the outcast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear me. I retract. Viola, Viola! it is for you to forgive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Viola waved him from her, and, smiling mournfully as she passed him
      by, glided from the chamber; and he did not dare to detain her.

</pre>
    <p>
      When Glyndon found himself without Viola&rsquo;s house, Mervale, still loitering
      at the door, seized his arm. Glyndon shook him off abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou and thy counsels,&rdquo; said he, bitterly, &ldquo;have made me a coward and a
      wretch. But I will go home,&mdash;I will write to her. I will pour out my
      whole soul; she will forgive me yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mervale, who was a man of imperturbable temper, arranged his ruffles,
      which his friend&rsquo;s angry gesture had a little discomposed, and not till
      Glyndon had exhausted himself awhile by passionate exclamations and
      reproaches, did the experienced angler begin to tighten the line. He then
      drew from Glyndon the explanation of what had passed, and artfully sought
      not to irritate, but soothe him. Mervale, indeed, was by no means a bad
      man; he had stronger moral notions than are common amongst the young. He
      sincerely reproved his friend for harbouring dishonourable intentions with
      regard to the actress. &ldquo;Because I would not have her thy wife, I never
      dreamed that thou shouldst degrade her to thy mistress. Better of the two
      an imprudent match than an illicit connection. But pause yet, do not act
      on the impulse of the moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is no time to lose. I have promised to Zanoni to give him my
      answer by to-morrow night. Later than that time, all option ceases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mervale, &ldquo;this seems suspicious. Explain yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Glyndon, in the earnestness of his passion, told his friend what had
      passed between himself and Zanoni,&mdash;suppressing only, he scarce knew
      why, the reference to his ancestor and the mysterious brotherhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      This recital gave to Mervale all the advantage he could desire. Heavens!
      with what sound, shrewd common-sense he talked. How evidently some
      charlatanic coalition between the actress, and perhaps,&mdash;who knows?&mdash;her
      clandestine protector, sated with possession! How equivocal the character
      of one,&mdash;the position of the other! What cunning in the question of
      the actress! How profoundly had Glyndon, at the first suggestion of his
      sober reason, seen through the snare. What! was he to be thus mystically
      cajoled and hurried into a rash marriage, because Zanoni, a mere stranger,
      told him with a grave face that he must decide before the clock struck a
      certain hour?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do this at least,&rdquo; said Mervale, reasonably enough,&mdash;&ldquo;wait till the
      time expires; it is but another day. Baffle Zanoni. He tells thee that he
      will meet thee before midnight to-morrow, and defies thee to avoid him.
      Pooh! let us quit Naples for some neighbouring place, where, unless he be
      indeed the Devil, he cannot possibly find us. Show him that you will not
      be led blindfold even into an act that you meditate yourself. Defer to
      write to her, or to see her, till after to-morrow. This is all I ask. Then
      visit her, and decide for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon was staggered. He could not combat the reasonings of his friend;
      he was not convinced, but he hesitated; and at that moment Nicot passed
      them. He turned round, and stopped, as he saw Glyndon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and do you think still of the Pisani?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have seen and conversed with her. She shall be Madame Nicot before this
      day week! I am going to the cafe, in the Toledo; and hark ye, when next
      you meet your friend Signor Zanoni, tell him that he has twice crossed my
      path. Jean Nicot, though a painter, is a plain, honest man, and always
      pays his debts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a good doctrine in money matters,&rdquo; said Mervale; &ldquo;as to revenge, it
      is not so moral, and certainly not so wise. But is it in your love that
      Zanoni has crossed your path? How that, if your suit prosper so well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Viola Pisani that question. Bah! Glyndon, she is a prude only to
      thee. But I have no prejudices. Once more, farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rouse thyself, man!&rdquo; said Mervale, slapping Glyndon on the shoulder.
      &ldquo;What think you of your fair one now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man must lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you write to her at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; if she be really playing a game, I could renounce her without a sigh.
      I will watch her closely; and, at all events, Zanoni shall not be the
      master of my fate. Let us, as you advise, leave Naples at daybreak
      to-morrow.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER 3.X.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     O chiunque tu sia, che fuor d&rsquo;ogni uso
     Pieghi Natura ad opre altere e strane,
     E, spiando i segreti, entri al piu chiuso
     Spazi&rsquo; a tua voglia delle menti umane&mdash;Deh, Dimmi!
     &ldquo;Gerus. Lib.,&rdquo; Cant. x. xviii.

     (O thou, whoever thou art, who through every use bendest Nature
     to works foreign and strange; and by spying into her secrets,
     enterest at thy will into the closest recesses of the human
     mind,&mdash;O speak!  O tell me!)
</pre>
    <p>
      Early the next morning the young Englishmen mounted their horses, and took
      the road towards Baiae. Glyndon left word at his hotel, that if Signor
      Zanoni sought him, it was in the neighbourhood of that once celebrated
      watering-place of the ancients that he should be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed by Viola&rsquo;s house, but Glyndon resisted the temptation of
      pausing there; and after threading the grotto of Posilipo, they wound by a
      circuitous route back into the suburbs of the city, and took the opposite
      road, which conducts to Portici and Pompeii. It was late at noon when they
      arrived at the former of these places. Here they halted to dine; for
      Mervale had heard much of the excellence of the macaroni at Portici, and
      Mervale was a bon vivant.
    </p>
    <p>
      They put up at an inn of very humble pretensions, and dined under an
      awning. Mervale was more than usually gay; he pressed the lacrima upon his
      friend, and conversed gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear friend, we have foiled Signor Zanoni in one of his
      predictions at least. You will have no faith in him hereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ides are come, not gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tush! If he be the soothsayer, you are not the Caesar. It is your vanity
      that makes you credulous. Thank Heaven, I do not think myself of such
      importance that the operations of Nature should be changed in order to
      frighten me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should the operations of Nature be changed? There may be a deeper
      philosophy than we dream of,&mdash;a philosophy that discovers the secrets
      of Nature, but does not alter, by penetrating, its courses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you relapse into your heretical credulity; you seriously suppose
      Zanoni to be a prophet,&mdash;a reader of the future; perhaps an associate
      of genii and spirits!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the landlord, a little, fat, oily fellow, came up with a fresh bottle
      of lacrima. He hoped their Excellencies were pleased. He was most touched&mdash;touched
      to the heart, that they liked the macaroni. Were their Excellencies going
      to Vesuvius? There was a slight eruption; they could not see it where they
      were, but it was pretty, and would be prettier still after sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A capital idea!&rdquo; cried Mervale. &ldquo;What say you, Glyndon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not yet seen an eruption; I should like it much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is there no danger?&rdquo; asked the prudent Mervale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not at all; the mountain is very civil at present. It only plays a
      little, just to amuse their Excellencies the English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, order the horses, and bring the bill; we will go before it is dark.
      Clarence, my friend,&mdash;nunc est bibendum; but take care of the pede
      libero, which will scarce do for walking on lava!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bottle was finished, the bill paid; the gentlemen mounted, the
      landlord bowed, and they bent their way, in the cool of the delightful
      evening, towards Resina.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wine, perhaps the excitement of his thoughts, animated Glyndon, whose
      unequal spirits were, at times, high and brilliant as those of a schoolboy
      released; and the laughter of the Northern tourists sounded oft and
      merrily along the melancholy domains of buried cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hesperus had lighted his lamp amidst the rosy skies as they arrived at
      Resina. Here they quitted their horses, and took mules and a guide. As the
      sky grew darker and more dark, the mountain fire burned with an intense
      lustre. In various streaks and streamlets, the fountain of flame rolled
      down the dark summit, and the Englishmen began to feel increase upon them,
      as they ascended, that sensation of solemnity and awe which makes the very
      atmosphere that surrounds the Giant of the Plains of the Antique Hades.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was night, when, leaving the mules, they ascended on foot, accompanied
      by their guide, and a peasant who bore a rude torch. The guide was a
      conversable, garrulous fellow, like most of his country and his calling;
      and Mervale, who possessed a sociable temper, loved to amuse or to
      instruct himself on every incidental occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Excellency,&rdquo; said the guide, &ldquo;your countrymen have a strong passion
      for the volcano. Long life to them, they bring us plenty of money! If our
      fortunes depended on the Neapolitans, we should starve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, they have no curiosity,&rdquo; said Mervale. &ldquo;Do you remember, Glyndon,
      the contempt with which that old count said to us, &lsquo;You will go to
      Vesuvius, I suppose? I have never been; why should I go? You have cold,
      you have hunger, you have fatigue, you have danger, and all for nothing
      but to see fire, which looks just as well in a brazier as on a mountain.&rsquo; 
      Ha! ha! the old fellow was right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Excellency,&rdquo; said the guide, &ldquo;that is not all: some cavaliers think
      to ascend the mountain without our help. I am sure they deserve to tumble
      into the crater.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must be bold fellows to go alone; you don&rsquo;t often find such.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes among the French, signor. But the other night&mdash;I never was
      so frightened&mdash;I had been with an English party, and a lady had left
      a pocket-book on the mountain, where she had been sketching. She offered
      me a handsome sum to return for it, and bring it to her at Naples. So I
      went in the evening. I found it, sure enough, and was about to return,
      when I saw a figure that seemed to emerge from the crater itself. The air
      there was so pestiferous that I could not have conceived a human creature
      could breathe it, and live. I was so astounded that I stood still as a
      stone, till the figure came over the hot ashes, and stood before me, face
      to face. Santa Maria, what a head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! hideous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; so beautiful, but so terrible. It had nothing human in its aspect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what said the salamander?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing! It did not even seem to perceive me, though I was near as I am
      to you; but its eyes seemed to emerge prying into the air. It passed by me
      quickly, and, walking across a stream of burning lava, soon vanished on
      the other side of the mountain. I was curious and foolhardy, and resolved
      to see if I could bear the atmosphere which this visitor had left; but
      though I did not advance within thirty yards of the spot at which he had
      first appeared, I was driven back by a vapour that wellnigh stifled me.
      Cospetto! I have spat blood ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now will I lay a wager that you fancy this fire-king must be Zanoni,&rdquo;
       whispered Mervale, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little party had now arrived nearly at the summit of the mountain; and
      unspeakably grand was the spectacle on which they gazed. From the crater
      arose a vapour, intensely dark, that overspread the whole background of
      the heavens; in the centre whereof rose a flame that assumed a form
      singularly beautiful. It might have been compared to a crest of gigantic
      feathers, the diadem of the mountain, high-arched, and drooping downward,
      with the hues delicately shaded off, and the whole shifting and tremulous
      as the plumage on a warrior&rsquo;s helmet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glare of the flame spread, luminous and crimson, over the dark and
      rugged ground on which they stood, and drew an innumerable variety of
      shadows from crag and hollow. An oppressive and sulphureous exhalation
      served to increase the gloomy and sublime terror of the place. But on
      turning from the mountain, and towards the distant and unseen ocean, the
      contrast was wonderfully great; the heavens serene and blue, the stars
      still and calm as the eyes of Divine Love. It was as if the realms of the
      opposing principles of Evil and of Good were brought in one view before
      the gaze of man! Glyndon&mdash;once more the enthusiast, the artist&mdash;was
      enchained and entranced by emotions vague and undefinable, half of delight
      and half of pain. Leaning on the shoulder of his friend, he gazed around
      him, and heard with deepening awe the rumbling of the earth below, the
      wheels and voices of the Ministry of Nature in her darkest and most
      inscrutable recess. Suddenly, as a bomb from a shell, a huge stone was
      flung hundreds of yards up from the jaws of the crater, and falling with a
      mighty crash upon the rock below, split into ten thousand fragments, which
      bounded down the sides of the mountain, sparkling and groaning as they
      went. One of these, the largest fragment, struck the narrow space of soil
      between the Englishmen and the guide, not three feet from the spot where
      the former stood. Mervale uttered an exclamation of terror, and Glyndon
      held his breath, and shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diavolo!&rdquo; cried the guide. &ldquo;Descend, Excellencies,&mdash;descend! we have
      not a moment to lose; follow me close!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the guide and the peasant fled with as much swiftness as they
      were able to bring to bear. Mervale, ever more prompt and ready than his
      friend, imitated their example; and Glyndon, more confused than alarmed,
      followed close. But they had not gone many yards, before, with a rushing
      and sudden blast, came from the crater an enormous volume of vapour. It
      pursued,&mdash;it overtook, it overspread them. It swept the light from
      the heavens. All was abrupt and utter darkness; and through the gloom was
      heard the shout of the guide, already distant, and lost in an instant
      amidst the sound of the rushing gust and the groans of the earth beneath.
      Glyndon paused. He was separated from his friend, from the guide. He was
      alone,&mdash;with the Darkness and the Terror. The vapour rolled sullenly
      away; the form of the plumed fire was again dimly visible, and its
      struggling and perturbed reflection again shed a glow over the horrors of
      the path. Glyndon recovered himself, and sped onward. Below, he heard the
      voice of Mervale calling on him, though he no longer saw his form. The
      sound served as a guide. Dizzy and breathless, he bounded forward; when&mdash;hark!&mdash;a
      sullen, slow rolling sounded in his ear! He halted,&mdash;and turned back
      to gaze. The fire had overflowed its course; it had opened itself a
      channel amidst the furrows of the mountain. The stream pursued him fast&mdash;fast;
      and the hot breath of the chasing and preternatural foe came closer and
      closer upon his cheek! He turned aside; he climbed desperately with hands
      and feet upon a crag that, to the right, broke the scathed and blasted
      level of the soil. The stream rolled beside and beneath him, and then
      taking a sudden wind round the spot on which he stood, interposed its
      liquid fire,&mdash;a broad and impassable barrier between his
      resting-place and escape. There he stood, cut off from descent, and with
      no alternative but to retrace his steps towards the crater, and thence
      seek, without guide or clew, some other pathway.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment his courage left him; he cried in despair, and in that
      overstrained pitch of voice which is never heard afar off, to the guide,
      to Mervale, to return to aid him.
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer came; and the Englishman, thus abandoned solely to his own
      resources, felt his spirit and energy rise against the danger. He turned
      back, and ventured as far towards the crater as the noxious exhalation
      would permit; then, gazing below, carefully and deliberately he chalked
      out for himself a path by which he trusted to shun the direction the
      fire-stream had taken, and trod firmly and quickly over the crumbling and
      heated strata.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had proceeded about fifty yards, when he halted abruptly; an
      unspeakable and unaccountable horror, not hitherto experienced amidst all
      his peril, came over him. He shook in every limb; his muscles refused his
      will,&mdash;he felt, as it were, palsied and death-stricken. The horror, I
      say, was unaccountable, for the path seemed clear and safe. The fire,
      above and behind, burned clear and far; and beyond, the stars lent him
      their cheering guidance. No obstacle was visible,&mdash;no danger seemed
      at hand. As thus, spell-bound, and panic-stricken, he stood chained to the
      soil,&mdash;his breast heaving, large drops rolling down his brow, and his
      eyes starting wildly from their sockets,&mdash;he saw before him, at some
      distance, gradually shaping itself more and more distinctly to his gaze, a
      colossal shadow; a shadow that seemed partially borrowed from the human
      shape, but immeasurably above the human stature; vague, dark, almost
      formless; and differing, he could not tell where or why, not only from the
      proportions, but also from the limbs and outline of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glare of the volcano, that seemed to shrink and collapse from this
      gigantic and appalling apparition, nevertheless threw its light, redly and
      steadily, upon another shape that stood beside, quiet and motionless; and
      it was, perhaps, the contrast of these two things&mdash;the Being and the
      Shadow&mdash;that impressed the beholder with the difference between them,&mdash;the
      Man and the Superhuman. It was but for a moment&mdash;nay, for the tenth
      part of a moment&mdash;that this sight was permitted to the wanderer. A
      second eddy of sulphureous vapours from the volcano, yet more rapidly, yet
      more densely than its predecessor, rolled over the mountain; and either
      the nature of the exhalation, or the excess of his own dread, was such,
      that Glyndon, after one wild gasp for breath, fell senseless on the earth.

      CHAPTER 3.XI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Was hab&rsquo;ich,
     Wenn ich nicht Alles habe?&mdash;sprach der Jungling.
     &ldquo;Das Verschleierte Bild zu Sais.&rdquo;
 
     (&ldquo;What have I, if I possess not All?&rdquo; said the youth.)
</pre>
    <p>
      Mervale and the Italians arrived in safety at the spot where they had left
      the mules; and not till they had recovered their own alarm and breath did
      they think of Glyndon. But then, as the minutes passed, and he appeared
      not, Mervale, whose heart was as good at least as human hearts are in
      general, grew seriously alarmed. He insisted on returning to search for
      his friend; and by dint of prodigal promises prevailed at last on the
      guide to accompany him. The lower part of the mountain lay calm and white
      in the starlight; and the guide&rsquo;s practised eye could discern all objects
      on the surface at a considerable distance. They had not, however, gone
      very far, before they perceived two forms slowly approaching them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they came near, Mervale recognised the form of his friend. &ldquo;Thank
      Heaven, he is safe!&rdquo; he cried, turning to the guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy angels befriend us!&rdquo; said the Italian, trembling,&mdash;&ldquo;behold the
      very being that crossed me last Friday night. It is he, but his face is
      human now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signor Inglese,&rdquo; said the voice of Zanoni, as Glyndon&mdash;pale, wan,
      and silent&mdash;returned passively the joyous greeting of Mervale,&mdash;&ldquo;Signor
      Inglese, I told your friend that we should meet to-night. You see you have
      NOT foiled my prediction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how?&mdash;but where?&rdquo; stammered Mervale, in great confusion and
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found your friend stretched on the ground, overpowered by the mephitic
      exhalation of the crater. I bore him to a purer atmosphere; and as I know
      the mountain well, I have conducted him safely to you. This is all our
      history. You see, sir, that were it not for that prophecy which you
      desired to frustrate, your friend would ere this time have been a corpse;
      one minute more, and the vapour had done its work. Adieu; goodnight, and
      pleasant dreams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my preserver, you will not leave us?&rdquo; said Glyndon, anxiously, and
      speaking for the first time. &ldquo;Will you not return with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanoni paused, and drew Glyndon aside. &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said he, gravely, &ldquo;it
      is necessary that we should again meet to-night. It is necessary that you
      should, ere the first hour of morning, decide on your own fate. I know
      that you have insulted her whom you profess to love. It is not too late to
      repent. Consult not your friend: he is sensible and wise; but not now is
      his wisdom needed. There are times in life when, from the imagination, and
      not the reason, should wisdom come,&mdash;this, for you, is one of them. I
      ask not your answer now. Collect your thoughts,&mdash;recover your jaded
      and scattered spirits. It wants two hours of midnight. Before midnight I
      will be with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Incomprehensible being!&rdquo; replied the Englishman, &ldquo;I would leave the life
      you have preserved in your own hands; but what I have seen this night has
      swept even Viola from my thoughts. A fiercer desire than that of love
      burns in my veins,&mdash;the desire not to resemble but to surpass my
      kind; the desire to penetrate and to share the secret of your own
      existence&mdash;the desire of a preternatural knowledge and unearthly
      power. I make my choice. In my ancestor&rsquo;s name, I adjure and remind thee
      of thy pledge. Instruct me; school me; make me thine; and I surrender to
      thee at once, and without a murmur, the woman whom, till I saw thee, I
      would have defied a world to obtain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bid thee consider well: on the one hand, Viola, a tranquil home, a
      happy and serene life; on the other hand, all is darkness,&mdash;darkness,
      that even these eyes cannot penetrate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But thou hast told me, that if I wed Viola, I must be contented with the
      common existence,&mdash;if I refuse, it is to aspire to thy knowledge and
      thy power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vain man, knowledge and power are not happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they are better than happiness. Say!&mdash;if I marry Viola, wilt
      thou be my master,&mdash;my guide? Say this, and I am resolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I renounce her? I renounce love. I renounce happiness. Welcome
      solitude,&mdash;welcome despair; if they are the entrances to thy dark and
      sublime secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not take thy answer now. Before the last hour of night thou shalt
      give it in one word,&mdash;ay or no! Farewell till then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanoni waved his hand, and, descending rapidly, was seen no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon rejoined his impatient and wondering friend; but Mervale, gazing
      on his face, saw that a great change had passed there. The flexile and
      dubious expression of youth was forever gone. The features were locked,
      rigid, and stern; and so faded was the natural bloom, that an hour seemed
      to have done the work of years.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 3.XII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Was ist&rsquo;s
     Das hinter diesem Schleier sich verbirgt?
     &ldquo;Das Verschleierte Bild zu Sais.&rdquo;
 
     (What is it that conceals itself behind this veil?)
</pre>
    <p>
      On returning from Vesuvius or Pompeii, you enter Naples through its most
      animated, its most Neapolitan quarter,&mdash;through that quarter in which
      modern life most closely resembles the ancient; and in which, when, on a
      fair-day, the thoroughfare swarms alike with Indolence and Trade, you are
      impressed at once with the recollection of that restless, lively race from
      which the population of Naples derives its origin; so that in one day you
      may see at Pompeii the habitations of a remote age; and on the Mole, at
      Naples, you may imagine you behold the very beings with whom those
      habitations had been peopled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, as the Englishmen rode slowly through the deserted streets,
      lighted but by the lamps of heaven, all the gayety of day was hushed and
      breathless. Here and there, stretched under a portico or a dingy booth,
      were sleeping groups of houseless Lazzaroni,&mdash;a tribe now merging its
      indolent individuality amidst an energetic and active population.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman rode on in silence; for Glyndon neither appeared to heed
      nor hear the questions and comments of Mervale, and Mervale himself was
      almost as weary as the jaded animal he bestrode.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the silence of earth and ocean was broken by the sound of a
      distant clock that proclaimed the quarter preceding the last hour of
      night. Glyndon started from his reverie, and looked anxiously round. As
      the final stroke died, the noise of hoofs rung on the broad stones of the
      pavement, and from a narrow street to the right emerged the form of a
      solitary horseman. He neared the Englishmen, and Glyndon recognised the
      features and mien of Zanoni.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! do we meet again, signor?&rdquo; said Mervale, in a vexed but drowsy
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend and I have business together,&rdquo; replied Zanoni, as he wheeled
      his steed to the side of Glyndon. &ldquo;But it will be soon transacted. Perhaps
      you, sir, will ride on to your hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no danger!&rdquo; returned Zanoni, with a slight expression of disdain
      in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None to me; but to Glyndon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Danger from me! Ah, perhaps you are right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, my dear Mervale,&rdquo; said Glyndon; &ldquo;I will join you before you reach
      the hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mervale nodded, whistled, and pushed his horse into a kind of amble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now your answer,&mdash;quick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have decided. The love of Viola has vanished from my heart. The pursuit
      is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have decided?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have; and now my reward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy reward! Well; ere this hour to-morrow it shall await thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanoni gave the rein to his horse; it sprang forward with a bound: the
      sparks flew from its hoofs, and horse and rider disappeared amidst the
      shadows of the street whence they had emerged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mervale was surprised to see his friend by his side, a minute after they
      had parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has passed between you and Zanoni?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mervale, do not ask me to-night! I am in a dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wonder at it, for even I am in a sleep. Let us push on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the retirement of his chamber, Glyndon sought to recollect his
      thoughts. He sat down on the foot of his bed, and pressed his hands
      tightly to his throbbing temples. The events of the last few hours; the
      apparition of the gigantic and shadowy Companion of the Mystic, amidst the
      fires and clouds of Vesuvius; the strange encounter with Zanoni himself,
      on a spot in which he could never, by ordinary reasoning, have calculated
      on finding Glyndon, filled his mind with emotions, in which terror and awe
      the least prevailed. A fire, the train of which had been long laid, was
      lighted at his heart,&mdash;the asbestos-fire that, once lit, is never to
      be quenched. All his early aspirations&mdash;his young ambition, his
      longings for the laurel&mdash;were merged in one passionate yearning to
      surpass the bounds of the common knowledge of man, and reach that solemn
      spot, between two worlds, on which the mysterious stranger appeared to
      have fixed his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far from recalling with renewed affright the remembrance of the apparition
      that had so appalled him, the recollection only served to kindle and
      concentrate his curiosity into a burning focus. He had said aright,&mdash;LOVE
      HAD VANISHED FROM HIS HEART; there was no longer a serene space amidst its
      disordered elements for human affection to move and breathe. The
      enthusiast was rapt from this earth; and he would have surrendered all
      that mortal beauty ever promised, that mortal hope ever whispered, for one
      hour with Zanoni beyond the portals of the visible world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, oppressed and fevered with the new thoughts that raged within
      him, and threw open his casement for air. The ocean lay suffused in the
      starry light, and the stillness of the heavens never more eloquently
      preached the morality of repose to the madness of earthly passions. But
      such was Glyndon&rsquo;s mood that their very hush only served to deepen the
      wild desires that preyed upon his soul; and the solemn stars, that are
      mysteries in themselves, seemed, by a kindred sympathy, to agitate the
      wings of the spirit no longer contented with its cage. As he gazed, a star
      shot from its brethren, and vanished from the depth of space!

     O, be gone!
     By Heaven, I love thee better than myself,
     For I came hither armed against myself.
     &mdash;&ldquo;Romeo and Juliet.&rdquo;
  </pre>
    <p>
      The young actress and Gionetta had returned from the theatre; and Viola
      fatigued and exhausted, had thrown herself on a sofa, while Gionetta
      busied herself with the long tresses which, released from the fillet that
      bound them, half-concealed the form of the actress, like a veil of threads
      of gold. As she smoothed the luxuriant locks, the old nurse ran gossiping
      on about the little events of the night, the scandal and politics of the
      scenes and the tireroom. Gionetta was a worthy soul. Almanzor, in Dryden&rsquo;s
      tragedy of &ldquo;Almahide,&rdquo; did not change sides with more gallant indifference
      than the exemplary nurse. She was at last grieved and scandalised that
      Viola had not selected one chosen cavalier. But the choice she left wholly
      to her fair charge. Zegri or Abencerrage, Glyndon or Zanoni, it had been
      the same to her, except that the rumours she had collected respecting the
      latter, combined with his own recommendations of his rival, had given her
      preference to the Englishman. She interpreted ill the impatient and heavy
      sigh with which Viola greeted her praises of Glyndon, and her wonder that
      he had of late so neglected his attentions behind the scenes, and she
      exhausted all her powers of panegyric upon the supposed object of the
      sigh. &ldquo;And then, too,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if nothing else were to be said against
      the other signor, it is enough that he is about to leave Naples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave Naples!&mdash;Zanoni?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, darling! In passing by the Mole to-day, there was a crowd round some
      outlandish-looking sailors. His ship arrived this morning, and anchors in
      the bay. The sailors say that they are to be prepared to sail with the
      first wind; they were taking in fresh stores. They&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me, Gionetta! Leave me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The time had already passed when the girl could confide in Gionetta. Her
      thoughts had advanced to that point when the heart recoils from all
      confidence, and feels that it cannot be comprehended. Alone now, in the
      principal apartment of the house, she paced its narrow boundaries with
      tremulous and agitated steps: she recalled the frightful suit of Nicot,&mdash;the
      injurious taunt of Glyndon; and she sickened at the remembrance of the
      hollow applauses which, bestowed on the actress, not the woman, only
      subjected her to contumely and insult. In that room the recollection of
      her father&rsquo;s death, the withered laurel and the broken chords, rose
      chillingly before her. Hers, she felt, was a yet gloomier fate,&mdash;the
      chords may break while the laurel is yet green. The lamp, waning in its
      socket, burned pale and dim, and her eyes instinctively turned from the
      darker corner of the room. Orphan, by the hearth of thy parent, dost thou
      fear the presence of the dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      And was Zanoni indeed about to quit Naples? Should she see him no more?
      Oh, fool, to think that there was grief in any other thought! The past!&mdash;that
      was gone! The future!&mdash;there was no future to her, Zanoni absent! But
      this was the night of the third day on which Zanoni had told her that,
      come what might, he would visit her again. It was, then, if she might
      believe him, some appointed crisis in her fate; and how should she tell
      him of Glyndon&rsquo;s hateful words? The pure and the proud mind can never
      confide its wrongs to another, only its triumphs and its happiness. But at
      that late hour would Zanoni visit her,&mdash;could she receive him?
      Midnight was at hand. Still in undefined suspense, in intense anxiety, she
      lingered in the room. The quarter before midnight sounded, dull and
      distant. All was still, and she was about to pass to her sleeping-room,
      when she heard the hoofs of a horse at full speed; the sound ceased, there
      was a knock at the door. Her heart beat violently; but fear gave way to
      another sentiment when she heard a voice, too well known, calling on her
      name. She paused, and then, with the fearlessness of innocence, descended
      and unbarred the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zanoni entered with a light and hasty step. His horseman&rsquo;s cloak fitted
      tightly to his noble form, and his broad hat threw a gloomy shade over his
      commanding features.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl followed him into the room she had just left, trembling and
      blushing deeply, and stood before him with the lamp she held shining
      upward on her cheek and the long hair that fell like a shower of light
      over the half-clad shoulders and heaving bust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Viola,&rdquo; said Zanoni, in a voice that spoke deep emotion, &ldquo;I am by thy
      side once more to save thee. Not a moment is to be lost. Thou must fly
      with me, or remain the victim of the Prince di &mdash;. I would have made
      the charge I now undertake another&rsquo;s; thou knowest I would,&mdash;thou
      knowest it!&mdash;but he is not worthy of thee, the cold Englishman! I
      throw myself at thy feet; have trust in me, and fly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He grasped her hand passionately as he dropped on his knee, and looked up
      into her face with his bright, beseeching eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fly with thee!&rdquo; said Viola, scarce believing her senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With me. Name, fame, honour,&mdash;all will be sacrificed if thou dost
      not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;then,&rdquo; said the wild girl, falteringly, and turning aside her
      face,&mdash;&ldquo;then I am not indifferent to thee; thou wouldst not give me
      to another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanoni was silent; but his breast heaved, his cheeks flushed, his eyes
      darted dark and impassioned fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; exclaimed Viola, in jealous suspicion of his silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indifferent to me! No; but I dare not yet say that I love thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what matters my fate?&rdquo; said Viola, turning pale, and shrinking from
      his side; &ldquo;leave me,&mdash;I fear no danger. My life, and therefore my
      honour, is in mine own hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be not so mad,&rdquo; said Zanoni. &ldquo;Hark! do you hear the neigh of my steed?&mdash;it
      is an alarm that warns us of the approaching peril. Haste, or you are
      lost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why dost thou care for me?&rdquo; said the girl, bitterly. &ldquo;Thou hast read my
      heart; thou knowest that thou art become the lord of my destiny. But to be
      bound beneath the weight of a cold obligation; to be the beggar on the
      eyes of indifference; to cast myself on one who loves me not,&mdash;THAT
      were indeed the vilest sin of my sex. Ah, Zanoni, rather let me die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had thrown back her clustering hair from her face while she spoke; and
      as she now stood, with her arms drooping mournfully, and her hands clasped
      together with the proud bitterness of her wayward spirit, giving new zest
      and charm to her singular beauty, it was impossible to conceive a sight
      more irresistible to the eye and the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tempt me not to thine own danger,&mdash;perhaps destruction!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Zanoni, in faltering accents. &ldquo;Thou canst not dream of what thou wouldst
      demand,&mdash;come!&rdquo; and, advancing, he wound his arm round her waist.
      &ldquo;Come, Viola; believe at least in my friendship, my honour, my protection&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not thy love,&rdquo; said the Italian, turning on him her reproachful eyes.
      Those eyes met his, and he could not withdraw from the charm of their
      gaze. He felt her heart throbbing beneath his own; her breath came warm
      upon his cheek. He trembled,&mdash;HE! the lofty, the mysterious Zanoni,
      who seemed to stand aloof from his race. With a deep and burning sigh, he
      murmured, &ldquo;Viola, I love thee! Oh!&rdquo; he continued passionately, and,
      releasing his hold, he threw himself abruptly at her feet, &ldquo;I no more
      command,&mdash;as woman should be wooed, I woo thee. From the first glance
      of those eyes, from the first sound of thy voice, thou becamest too
      fatally dear to me. Thou speakest of fascination,&mdash;it lives and it
      breathes in thee! I fled from Naples to fly from thy presence,&mdash;it
      pursued me. Months, years passed, and thy sweet face still shone upon my
      heart. I returned, because I pictured thee alone and sorrowful in the
      world, and knew that dangers, from which I might save thee, were gathering
      near thee and around. Beautiful Soul! whose leaves I have read with
      reverence, it was for thy sake, thine alone, that I would have given thee
      to one who might make thee happier on earth than I can. Viola! Viola! thou
      knowest not&mdash;never canst thou know&mdash;how dear thou art to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is in vain to seek for words to describe the delight&mdash;the proud,
      the full, the complete, and the entire delight&mdash;that filled the heart
      of the Neapolitan. He whom she had considered too lofty even for love,&mdash;more
      humble to her than those she had half-despised! She was silent, but her
      eyes spoke to him; and then slowly, as aware, at last, that the human love
      had advanced on the ideal, she shrank into the terrors of a modest and
      virtuous nature. She did not dare,&mdash;she did not dream to ask him the
      question she had so fearlessly made to Glyndon; but she felt a sudden
      coldness,&mdash;a sense that a barrier was yet between love and love. &ldquo;Oh,
      Zanoni!&rdquo; she murmured, with downcast eyes, &ldquo;ask me not to fly with thee;
      tempt me not to my shame. Thou wouldst protect me from others. Oh, protect
      me from thyself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor orphan!&rdquo; said he, tenderly, &ldquo;and canst thou think that I ask from
      thee one sacrifice,&mdash;still less the greatest that woman can give to
      love? As my wife I woo thee, and by every tie, and by every vow that can
      hallow and endear affection. Alas! they have belied love to thee indeed,
      if thou dost not know the religion that belongs to it! They who truly love
      would seek, for the treasure they obtain, every bond that can make it
      lasting and secure. Viola, weep not, unless thou givest me the holy right
      to kiss away thy tears!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that beautiful face, no more averted, drooped upon his bosom; and as
      he bent down, his lips sought the rosy mouth: a long and burning kiss,&mdash;danger,
      life, the world was forgotten! Suddenly Zanoni tore himself from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hearest thou the wind that sighs, and dies away? As that wind, my power
      to preserve thee, to guard thee, to foresee the storm in thy skies, is
      gone. No matter. Haste, haste; and may love supply the loss of all that it
      has dared to sacrifice! Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Viola hesitated no more. She threw her mantle over her shoulders, and
      gathered up her dishevelled hair; a moment, and she was prepared, when a
      sudden crash was heard below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late!&mdash;fool that I was, too late!&rdquo; cried Zanoni, in a sharp tone
      of agony, as he hurried to the door. He opened it, only to be borne back
      by the press of armed men. The room literally swarmed with the followers
      of the ravisher, masked, and armed to the teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viola was already in the grasp of two of the myrmidons. Her shriek smote
      the ear of Zanoni. He sprang forward; and Viola heard his wild cry in a
      foreign tongue. She saw the blades of the ruffians pointed at his breast!
      She lost her senses; and when she recovered, she found herself gagged, and
      in a carriage that was driven rapidly, by the side of a masked and
      motionless figure. The carriage stopped at the portals of a gloomy
      mansion. The gates opened noiselessly; a broad flight of steps,
      brilliantly illumined, was before her. She was in the palace of the Prince
      di &mdash;.

      CHAPTER 3.XIV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Ma lasciamo, per Dio, Signore, ormai
     Di parlar d&rsquo; ira, e di cantar di morte.
     &ldquo;Orlando Furioso,&rdquo; Canto xvii. xvii.

     (But leave me, I solemnly conjure thee, signor, to speak of
     wrath, and to sing of death.)
</pre>
    <p>
      The young actress was led to, and left alone in a chamber adorned with all
      the luxurious and half-Eastern taste that at one time characterised the
      palaces of the great seigneurs of Italy. Her first thought was for Zanoni.
      Was he yet living? Had he escaped unscathed the blades of the foe,&mdash;her
      new treasure, the new light of her life, her lord, at last her lover?
    </p>
    <p>
      She had short time for reflection. She heard steps approaching the
      chamber; she drew back, but trembled not. A courage not of herself, never
      known before, sparkled in her eyes, and dilated her stature. Living or
      dead, she would be faithful still to Zanoni! There was a new motive to the
      preservation of honour. The door opened, and the prince entered in the
      gorgeous and gaudy custume still worn at that time in Naples.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair and cruel one,&rdquo; said he, advancing with a half-sneer upon his lip,
      &ldquo;thou wilt not too harshly blame the violence of love.&rdquo; He attempted to
      take her hand as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said he, as she recoiled, &ldquo;reflect that thou art now in the power
      of one that never faltered in the pursuit of an object less dear to him
      than thou art. Thy lover, presumptuous though he be, is not by to save
      thee. Mine thou art; but instead of thy master, suffer me to be thy
      slave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; said Viola, with a stern gravity, &ldquo;your boast is in vain. Your
      power! I am NOT in your power. Life and death are in my own hands. I will
      not defy; but I do not fear you. I feel&mdash;and in some feelings,&rdquo; added
      Viola, with a solemnity almost thrilling, &ldquo;there is all the strength, and
      all the divinity of knowledge&mdash;I feel that I am safe even here; but
      you&mdash;you, Prince di &mdash;, have brought danger to your home and
      hearth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Neapolitan seemed startled by an earnestness and boldness he was but
      little prepared for. He was not, however, a man easily intimidated or
      deterred from any purpose he had formed; and, approaching Viola, he was
      about to reply with much warmth, real or affected, when a knock was heard
      at the door of the chamber. The sound was repeated, and the prince, chafed
      at the interruption, opened the door and demanded impatiently who had
      ventured to disobey his orders, and invade his leisure. Mascari presented
      himself, pale and agitated: &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said he, in a whisper, &ldquo;pardon me;
      but a stranger is below, who insists on seeing you; and, from some words
      he let fall, I judged it advisable even to infringe your commands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A stranger!&mdash;and at this hour! What business can he pretend? Why was
      he even admitted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He asserts that your life is in imminent danger. The source whence it
      proceeds he will relate to your Excellency alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince frowned; but his colour changed. He mused a moment, and then,
      re-entering the chamber and advancing towards Viola, he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, fair creature, I have no wish to take advantage of my power.
      I would fain trust alone to the gentler authorities of affection. Hold
      yourself queen within these walls more absolutely than you have ever
      enacted that part on the stage. To-night, farewell! May your sleep be
      calm, and your dreams propitious to my hopes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words he retired, and in a few moments Viola was surrounded by
      officious attendants, whom she at length, with some difficulty, dismissed;
      and, refusing to retire to rest, she spent the night in examining the
      chamber, which she found was secured, and in thoughts of Zanoni, in whose
      power she felt an almost preternatural confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the prince descended the stairs and sought the room into which
      the stranger had been shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the visitor wrapped from head to foot in a long robe, half-gown,
      half-mantle, such as was sometimes worn by ecclesiastics. The face of this
      stranger was remarkable. So sunburnt and swarthy were his hues, that he
      must, apparently, have derived his origin amongst the races of the
      farthest East. His forehead was lofty, and his eyes so penetrating yet so
      calm in their gaze that the prince shrank from them as we shrink from a
      questioner who is drawing forth the guiltiest secret of our hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you with me?&rdquo; asked the prince, motioning his visitor to a
      seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince of &mdash;,&rdquo; said the stranger, in a voice deep and sweet, but
      foreign in its accent,&mdash;&ldquo;son of the most energetic and masculine race
      that ever applied godlike genius to the service of Human Will, with its
      winding wickedness and its stubborn grandeur; descendant of the great
      Visconti in whose chronicles lies the history of Italy in her palmy day,
      and in whose rise was the development of the mightiest intellect, ripened
      by the most restless ambition,&mdash;I come to gaze upon the last star in
      a darkening firmament. By this hour to-morrow space shall know it not.
      Man, unless thy whole nature change, thy days are numbered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What means this jargon?&rdquo; said the prince, in visible astonishment and
      secret awe. &ldquo;Comest thou to menace me in my own halls, or wouldst thou
      warn me of a danger? Art thou some itinerant mountebank, or some
      unguessed-of friend? Speak out, and plainly. What danger threatens me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zanoni and thy ancestor&rsquo;s sword,&rdquo; replied the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; said the prince, laughing scournfully; &ldquo;I half-suspected thee
      from the first. Thou art then the accomplice or the tool of that most
      dexterous, but, at present, defeated charlatan? And I suppose thou wilt
      tell me that if I were to release a certain captive I have made, the
      danger would vanish, and the hand of the dial would be put back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge of me as thou wilt, Prince di &mdash;. I confess my knowledge of
      Zanoni. Thou, too, wilt know his power, but not till it consume thee. I
      would save, therefore I warn thee. Dost thou ask me why? I will tell thee.
      Canst thou remember to have heard wild tales of thy grandsire; of his
      desire for a knowledge that passes that of the schools and cloisters; of a
      strange man from the East who was his familiar and master in lore against
      which the Vatican has, from age to age, launched its mimic thunder? Dost
      thou call to mind the fortunes of thy ancestor?&mdash;how he succeeded in
      youth to little but a name; how, after a career wild and dissolute as
      thine, he disappeared from Milan, a pauper, and a self-exile; how, after
      years spent, none knew in what climes or in what pursuits, he again
      revisited the city where his progenitors had reigned; how with him came
      the wise man of the East, the mystic Mejnour; how they who beheld him,
      beheld with amaze and fear that time had ploughed no furrow on his brow;
      that youth seemed fixed, as by a spell, upon his face and form? Dost thou
      not know that from that hour his fortunes rose? Kinsmen the most remote
      died; estate upon estate fell into the hands of the ruined noble. He
      became the guide of princes, the first magnate of Italy. He founded anew
      the house of which thou art the last lineal upholder, and transferred his
      splendour from Milan to the Sicilian realms. Visions of high ambition were
      then present with him nightly and daily. Had he lived, Italy would have
      known a new dynasty, and the Visconti would have reigned over
      Magna-Graecia. He was a man such as the world rarely sees; but his ends,
      too earthly, were at war with the means he sought. Had his ambition been
      more or less, he had been worthy of a realm mightier than the Caesars
      swayed; worthy of our solemn order; worthy of the fellowship of Mejnour,
      whom you now behold before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince, who had listened with deep and breathless attention to the
      words of his singular guest, started from his seat at his last words.
      &ldquo;Imposter!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;can you dare thus to play with my credulity? Sixty
      years have flown since my grandsire died; were he living, he had passed
      his hundred and twentieth year; and you, whose old age is erect and
      vigorous, have the assurance to pretend to have been his contemporary! But
      you have imperfectly learned your tale. You know not, it seems, that my
      grandsire, wise and illustrious indeed, in all save his faith in a
      charlatan, was found dead in his bed, in the very hour when his colossal
      plans were ripe for execution, and that Mejnour was guilty of his murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; answered the stranger, in a voice of great sadness, &ldquo;had he but
      listened to Mejnour,&mdash;had he but delayed the last and most perilous
      ordeal of daring wisdom until the requisite training and initiation had
      been completed,&mdash;your ancestor would have stood with me upon an
      eminence which the waters of Death itself wash everlastingly, but cannot
      overflow. Your grandsire resisted my fervent prayers, disobeyed my most
      absolute commands, and in the sublime rashness of a soul that panted for
      secrets, which he who desires orbs and sceptres never can obtain,
      perished, the victim of his own frenzy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was poisoned, and Mejnour fled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mejnour fled not,&rdquo; answered the stranger, proudly&mdash;&ldquo;Mejnour could
      not fly from danger; for to him danger is a thing long left behind. It was
      the day before the duke took the fatal draft which he believed was to
      confer on the mortal the immortal boon, that, finding my power over him
      was gone, I abandoned him to his doom. But a truce with this: I loved your
      grandsire! I would save the last of his race. Oppose not thyself to
      Zanoni. Yield not thy soul to thine evil passions. Draw back from the
      precipice while there is yet time. In thy front, and in thine eyes, I
      detect some of that diviner glory which belonged to thy race. Thou hast in
      thee some germs of their hereditary genius, but they are choked up by
      worse than thy hereditary vices. Recollect that by genius thy house rose;
      by vice it ever failed to perpetuate its power. In the laws which regulate
      the universe, it is decreed that nothing wicked can long endure. Be wise,
      and let history warn thee. Thou standest on the verge of two worlds, the
      past and the future; and voices from either shriek omen in thy ear. I have
      done. I bid thee farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so; thou shalt not quit these walls. I will make experiment of thy
      boasted power. What, ho there!&mdash;ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince shouted; the room was filled with his minions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seize that man!&rdquo; he cried, pointing to the spot which had been filled by
      the form of Mejnour. To his inconceivable amaze and horror, the spot was
      vacant. The mysterious stranger had vanished like a dream; but a thin and
      fragrant mist undulated, in pale volumes, round the walls of the chamber.
      &ldquo;Look to my lord,&rdquo; cried Mascari. The prince had fallen to the floor
      insensible. For many hours he seemed in a kind of trance. When he
      recovered, he dismissed his attendants, and his step was heard in his
      chamber, pacing to and fro, with heavy and disordered strides. Not till an
      hour before his banquet the next day did he seem restored to his wonted
      self.

      The sleep of Glyndon, the night after his last interview with Zanoni, was
      unusually profound; and the sun streamed full upon his eyes as he opened
      them to the day. He rose refreshed, and with a strange sentiment of
      calmness that seemed more the result of resolution than exhaustion. The
      incidents and emotions of the past night had settled into distinct and
      clear impressions. He thought of them but slightly,&mdash;he thought
      rather of the future. He was as one of the initiated in the old Egyptian
      mysteries who have crossed the gate only to long more ardently for the
      penetralia.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dressed himself, and was relieved to find that Mervale had joined a
      party of his countrymen on an excursion to Ischia. He spent the heat of
      noon in thoughtful solitude, and gradually the image of Viola returned to
      his heart. It was a holy&mdash;for it was a HUMAN&mdash;image. He had
      resigned her; and though he repented not, he was troubled at the thought
      that repentance would have come too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started impatiently from his seat, and strode with rapid steps to the
      humble abode of the actress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distance was considerable, and the air oppressive. Glyndon arrived at
      the door breathless and heated. He knocked; no answer came. He lifted the
      latch and entered. He ascended the stairs; no sound, no sight of life met
      his ear and eye. In the front chamber, on a table, lay the guitar of the
      actress, and some manuscript parts in the favourite operas. He paused,
      and, summoning courage, tapped at the door which seemed to lead into the
      inner apartment. The door was ajar; and, hearing no sound within, he
      pushed it open. It was the sleeping-chamber of the young actress, that
      holiest ground to a lover; and well did the place become the presiding
      deity: none of the tawdry finery of the profession was visible, on the one
      hand; none of the slovenly disorder common to the humbler classes of the
      South, on the other. All was pure and simple; even the ornaments were
      those of an innocent refinement,&mdash;a few books, placed carefully on
      shelves, a few half-faded flowers in an earthen vase, which was modelled
      and painted in the Etruscan fashion. The sunlight streamed over the snowy
      draperies of the bed, and a few articles of clothing on the chair beside
      it. Viola was not there; but the nurse!&mdash;was she gone also? He made
      the house resound with the name of Gionetta, but there was not even an
      echo to reply. At last, as he reluctantly quitted the desolate abode, he
      perceived Gionetta coming towards him from the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor old woman uttered an exclamation of joy on seeing him; but, to
      their mutual disappointment, neither had any cheerful tidings or
      satisfactory explanation to afford the other. Gionetta had been aroused
      from her slumber the night before by the noise in the rooms below; but ere
      she could muster courage to descend, Viola was gone! She found the marks
      of violence on the door without; and all she had since been able to learn
      in the neighbourhood was, that a Lazzarone, from his nocturnal
      resting-place on the Chiaja, had seen by the moonlight a carriage, which
      he recognised as belonging to the Prince di &mdash;, pass and repass that
      road about the first hour of morning. Glyndon, on gathering from the
      confused words and broken sobs of the old nurse the heads of this account,
      abruptly left her, and repaired to the palace of Zanoni. There he was
      informed that the signor was gone to the banquet of the Prince di &mdash;,
      and would not return till late. Glyndon stood motionless with perplexity
      and dismay; he knew not what to believe, or how to act. Even Mervale was
      not at hand to advise him. His conscience smote him bitterly. He had had
      the power to save the woman he had loved, and had foregone that power; but
      how was it that in this Zanoni himself had failed? How was it that he was
      gone to the very banquet of the ravisher? Could Zanoni be aware of what
      had passed? If not, should he lose a moment in apprising him? Though
      mentally irresolute, no man was more physically brave. He would repair at
      once to the palace of the prince himself; and if Zanoni failed in the
      trust he had half-appeared to arrogate, he, the humble foreigner, would
      demand the captive of fraud and force, in the very halls and before the
      assembled guests of the Prince di &mdash;.

    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Ardua vallatur duris sapientia scrupis.
     Hadr. Jun., &ldquo;Emblem.&rdquo; xxxvii.

     (Lofty wisdom is circled round with rugged rocks.)
</pre>
    <p>
      We must go back some hours in the progress of this narrative. It was the
      first faint and gradual break of the summer dawn; and two men stood in a
      balcony overhanging a garden fragrant with the scents of the awakening
      flowers. The stars had not yet left the sky,&mdash;the birds were yet
      silent on the boughs: all was still, hushed, and tranquil; but how
      different the tranquillity of reviving day from the solemn repose of
      night! In the music of silence there are a thousand variations. These men,
      who alone seemed awake in Naples, were Zanoni and the mysterious stranger
      who had but an hour or two ago startled the Prince di &mdash; in his
      voluptuous palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the latter; &ldquo;hadst thou delayed the acceptance of the Arch-gift
      until thou hadst attained to the years, and passed through all the
      desolate bereavements that chilled and seared myself ere my researches had
      made it mine, thou wouldst have escaped the curse of which thou
      complainest now,&mdash;thou wouldst not have mourned over the brevity of
      human affection as compared to the duration of thine own existence; for
      thou wouldst have survived the very desire and dream of the love of woman.
      Brightest, and, but for that error, perhaps the loftiest, of the secret
      and solemn race that fills up the interval in creation between mankind and
      the children of the Empyreal, age after age wilt thou rue the splendid
      folly which made thee ask to carry the beauty and the passions of youth
      into the dreary grandeur of earthly immortality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not repent, nor shall I,&rdquo; answered Zanoni. &ldquo;The transport and the
      sorrow, so wildly blended, which have at intervals diversified my doom,
      are better than the calm and bloodless tenor of thy solitary way&mdash;thou,
      who lovest nothing, hatest nothing, feelest nothing, and walkest the world
      with the noiseless and joyless footsteps of a dream!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mistake,&rdquo; replied he who had owned the name of Mejnour,&mdash;&ldquo;though
      I care not for love, and am dead to every PASSION that agitates the sons
      of clay, I am not dead to their more serene enjoyments. I carry down the
      stream of the countless years, not the turbulent desires of youth, but the
      calm and spiritual delights of age. Wisely and deliberately I abandoned
      youth forever when I separated my lot from men. Let us not envy or
      reproach each other. I would have saved this Neapolitan, Zanoni (since so
      it now pleases thee to be called), partly because his grandsire was but
      divided by the last airy barrier from our own brotherhood, partly because
      I know that in the man himself lurk the elements of ancestral courage and
      power, which in earlier life would have fitted him for one of us. Earth
      holds but few to whom Nature has given the qualities that can bear the
      ordeal. But time and excess, that have quickened his grosser senses, have
      blunted his imagination. I relinquish him to his doom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And still, then, Mejnour, you cherish the desire to revive our order,
      limited now to ourselves alone, by new converts and allies. Surely&mdash;surely&mdash;thy
      experience might have taught thee, that scarcely once in a thousand years
      is born the being who can pass through the horrible gates that lead into
      the worlds without! Is not thy path already strewed with thy victims? Do
      not their ghastly faces of agony and fear&mdash;the blood-stained suicide,
      the raving maniac&mdash;rise before thee, and warn what is yet left to
      thee of human sympathy from thy insane ambition?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; answered Mejnour; &ldquo;have I not had success to counterbalance
      failure? And can I forego this lofty and august hope, worthy alone of our
      high condition,&mdash;the hope to form a mighty and numerous race with a
      force and power sufficient to permit them to acknowledge to mankind their
      majestic conquests and dominion, to become the true lords of this planet,
      invaders, perchance, of others, masters of the inimical and malignant
      tribes by which at this moment we are surrounded: a race that may proceed,
      in their deathless destinies, from stage to stage of celestial glory, and
      rank at last amongst the nearest ministrants and agents gathered round the
      Throne of Thrones? What matter a thousand victims for one convert to our
      band? And you, Zanoni,&rdquo; continued Mejnour, after a pause,&mdash;&ldquo;you, even
      you, should this affection for a mortal beauty that you have dared,
      despite yourself, to cherish, be more than a passing fancy; should it,
      once admitted into your inmost nature, partake of its bright and enduring
      essence,&mdash;even you may brave all things to raise the beloved one into
      your equal. Nay, interrupt me not. Can you see sickness menace her; danger
      hover around; years creep on; the eyes grow dim; the beauty fade, while
      the heart, youthful still, clings and fastens round your own,&mdash;can
      you see this, and know it is yours to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cease!&rdquo; cried Zanoni, fiercely. &ldquo;What is all other fate as compared to
      the death of terror? What, when the coldest sage, the most heated
      enthusiast, the hardiest warrior with his nerves of iron, have been found
      dead in their beds, with straining eyeballs and horrent hair, at the first
      step of the Dread Progress,&mdash;thinkest thou that this weak woman&mdash;from
      whose cheek a sound at the window, the screech of the night-owl, the sight
      of a drop of blood on a man&rsquo;s sword, would start the colour&mdash;could
      brave one glance of&mdash;Away! the very thought of such sights for her
      makes even myself a coward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you told her you loved her,&mdash;when you clasped her to your
      breast, you renounced all power to foresee her future lot, or protect her
      from harm. Henceforth to her you are human, and human only. How know you,
      then, to what you may be tempted; how know you what her curiosity may
      learn and her courage brave? But enough of this,&mdash;you are bent on
      your pursuit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fiat has gone forth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, at this hour, our bark will be bounding over yonder ocean, and
      the weight of ages will have fallen from my heart! I compassionate thee, O
      foolish sage,&mdash;THOU hast given up THY youth!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER 3.XVII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Alch:  Thou always speakest riddles.  Tell me if thou art that
     fountain of which Bernard Lord Trevizan writ?

     Merc:  I am not that fountain, but I am the water.  The fountain
     compasseth me about.

     Sandivogius, &ldquo;New Light of Alchymy.&rdquo;
  </pre>
    <p>
      The Prince di &mdash; was not a man whom Naples could suppose to be
      addicted to superstitious fancies. Still, in the South of Italy, there was
      then, and there still lingers a certain spirit of credulity, which may,
      ever and anon, be visible amidst the boldest dogmas of their philosophers
      and sceptics. In his childhood, the prince had learned strange tales of
      the ambition, the genius, and the career of his grandsire,&mdash;and
      secretly, perhaps influenced by ancestral example, in earlier youth he
      himself had followed science, not only through her legitimate course, but
      her antiquated and erratic windings. I have, indeed, been shown in Naples
      a little volume, blazoned with the arms of the Visconti, and ascribed to
      the nobleman I refer to, which treats of alchemy in a spirit half-mocking
      and half-reverential.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pleasure soon distracted him from such speculations, and his talents,
      which were unquestionably great, were wholly perverted to extravagant
      intrigues, or to the embellishment of a gorgeous ostentation with
      something of classic grace. His immense wealth, his imperious pride, his
      unscrupulous and daring character, made him an object of no inconsiderable
      fear to a feeble and timid court; and the ministers of the indolent
      government willingly connived at excesses which allured him at least from
      ambition. The strange visit and yet more strange departure of Mejnour
      filled the breast of the Neapolitan with awe and wonder, against which all
      the haughty arrogance and learned scepticism of his maturer manhood
      combated in vain. The apparition of Mejnour served, indeed, to invest
      Zanoni with a character in which the prince had not hitherto regarded him.
      He felt a strange alarm at the rival he had braved,&mdash;at the foe he
      had provoked. When, a little before his banquet, he had resumed his
      self-possession, it was with a fell and gloomy resolution that he brooded
      over the perfidious schemes he had previously formed. He felt as if the
      death of the mysterious Zanoni were necessary for the preservation of his
      own life; and if at an earlier period of their rivalry he had determined
      on the fate of Zanoni, the warnings of Mejnour only served to confirm his
      resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will try if his magic can invent an antidote to the bane,&rdquo; said he,
      half-aloud, and with a stern smile, as he summoned Mascari to his
      presence. The poison which the prince, with his own hands, mixed into the
      wine intended for his guest, was compounded from materials, the secret of
      which had been one of the proudest heir-looms of that able and evil race
      which gave to Italy her wisest and guiltiest tyrants. Its operation was
      quick yet not sudden: it produced no pain,&mdash;it left on the form no
      grim convulsion, on the skin no purpling spot, to arouse suspicion; you
      might have cut and carved every membrane and fibre of the corpse, but the
      sharpest eyes of the leech would not have detected the presence of the
      subtle life-queller. For twelve hours the victim felt nothing save a
      joyous and elated exhilaration of the blood; a delicious languor followed,
      the sure forerunner of apoplexy. No lancet then could save! Apoplexy had
      run much in the families of the enemies of the Visconti!
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour of the feast arrived,&mdash;the guests assembled. There were the
      flower of the Neapolitan seignorie, the descendants of the Norman, the
      Teuton, the Goth; for Naples had then a nobility, but derived it from the
      North, which has indeed been the Nutrix Leonum,&mdash;the nurse of the
      lion-hearted chivalry of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last of the guests came Zanoni; and the crowd gave way as the dazzling
      foreigner moved along to the lord of the palace. The prince greeted him
      with a meaning smile, to which Zanoni answered by a whisper, &ldquo;He who plays
      with loaded dice does not always win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince bit his lip, and Zanoni, passing on, seemed deep in
      conversation with the fawning Mascari.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the prince&rsquo;s heir?&rdquo; asked the guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A distant relation on the mother&rsquo;s side; with his Excellency dies the
      male line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the heir present at our host&rsquo;s banquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; they are not friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter; he will be here to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mascari stared in surprise; but the signal for the banquet was given, and
      the guests were marshalled to the board. As was the custom then, the feast
      took place not long after mid-day. It was a long, oval hall, the whole of
      one side opening by a marble colonnade upon a court or garden, in which
      the eye rested gratefully upon cool fountains and statues of whitest
      marble, half-sheltered by orange-trees. Every art that luxury could invent
      to give freshness and coolness to the languid and breezeless heat of the
      day without (a day on which the breath of the sirocco was abroad) had been
      called into existence. Artificial currents of air through invisible tubes,
      silken blinds waving to and fro, as if to cheat the senses into the belief
      of an April wind, and miniature jets d&rsquo;eau in each corner of the
      apartment, gave to the Italians the same sense of exhilaration and COMFORT
      (if I may use the word) which the well-drawn curtains and the blazing
      hearth afford to the children of colder climes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was somewhat more lively and intellectual than is common
      amongst the languid pleasure-hunters of the South; for the prince, himself
      accomplished, sought his acquaintance not only amongst the beaux esprits
      of his own country, but amongst the gay foreigners who adorned and
      relieved the monotony of the Neapolitan circles. There were present two or
      three of the brilliant Frenchmen of the old regime, who had already
      emigrated from the advancing Revolution; and their peculiar turn of
      thought and wit was well calculated for the meridian of a society that
      made the dolce far niente at once its philosophy and its faith. The
      prince, however, was more silent than usual; and when he sought to rouse
      himself, his spirits were forced and exaggerated. To the manners of his
      host, those of Zanoni afforded a striking contrast. The bearing of this
      singular person was at all times characterised by a calm and polished
      ease, which was attributed by the courtiers to the long habit of society.
      He could scarcely be called gay; yet few persons more tended to animate
      the general spirits of a convivial circle. He seemed, by a kind of
      intuition, to elicit from each companion the qualities in which he most
      excelled; and if occasionally a certain tone of latent mockery
      characterised his remarks upon the topics on which the conversation fell,
      it appeared to men who took nothing in earnest to be the language both of
      wit and wisdom. To the Frenchmen, in particular, there was something
      startling in his intimate knowledge of the minutest events in their own
      capital and country, and his profound penetration (evinced but in epigrams
      and sarcasms) into the eminent characters who were then playing a part
      upon the great stage of continental intrigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was while this conversation grew animated, and the feast was at its
      height, that Glyndon arrived at the palace. The porter, perceiving by his
      dress that he was not one of the invited guests, told him that his
      Excellency was engaged, and on no account could be disturbed; and Glyndon
      then, for the first time, became aware how strange and embarrassing was
      the duty he had taken on himself. To force an entrance into the
      banquet-hall of a great and powerful noble, surrounded by the rank of
      Naples, and to arraign him for what to his boon-companions would appear
      but an act of gallantry, was an exploit that could not fail to be at once
      ludicrous and impotent. He mused a moment, and, slipping a piece of gold
      into the porter&rsquo;s hand, said that he was commissioned to seek the Signor
      Zanoni upon an errand of life and death, and easily won his way across the
      court, and into the interior building. He passed up the broad staircase,
      and the voices and merriment of the revellers smote his ear at a distance.
      At the entrance of the reception-rooms he found a page, whom he despatched
      with a message to Zanoni. The page did the errand; and Zanoni, on hearing
      the whispered name of Glyndon, turned to his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, my lord; an English friend of mine, the Signor Glyndon (not
      unknown by name to your Excellency) waits without,&mdash;the business must
      indeed be urgent on which he has sought me in such an hour. You will
      forgive my momentary absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, signor,&rdquo; answered the prince, courteously, but with a sinister smile
      on his countenance, &ldquo;would it not be better for your friend to join us? An
      Englishman is welcome everywhere; and even were he a Dutchman, your
      friendship would invest his presence with attraction. Pray his attendance;
      we would not spare you even for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanoni bowed; the page was despatched with all flattering messages to
      Glyndon,&mdash;a seat next to Zanoni was placed for him, and the young
      Englishman entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are most welcome, sir. I trust your business to our illustrious guest
      is of good omen and pleasant import. If you bring evil news, defer it, I
      pray you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon&rsquo;s brow was sullen; and he was about to startle the guests by his
      reply, when Zanoni, touching his arm significantly, whispered in English,
      &ldquo;I know why you have sought me. Be silent, and witness what ensues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know then that Viola, whom you boasted you had the power to save from
      danger&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is in this house!&mdash;yes. I know also that Murder sits at the right
      hand of our host. But his fate is now separated from hers forever; and the
      mirror which glasses it to my eye is clear through the streams of blood.
      Be still, and learn the fate that awaits the wicked!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said Zanoni, speaking aloud, &ldquo;the Signor Glyndon has indeed
      brought me tidings not wholly unexpected. I am compelled to leave Naples,&mdash;an
      additional motive to make the most of the present hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what, if I may venture to ask, may be the cause that brings such
      affliction on the fair dames of Naples?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the approaching death of one who honoured me with most loyal
      friendship,&rdquo; replied Zanoni, gravely. &ldquo;Let us not speak of it; grief
      cannot put back the dial. As we supply by new flowers those that fade in
      our vases, so it is the secret of worldly wisdom to replace by fresh
      friendships those that fade from our path.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True philosophy!&rdquo; exclaimed the prince. &ldquo;&lsquo;Not to admire,&rsquo; was the Roman&rsquo;s
      maxim; &lsquo;Never to mourn,&rsquo; is mine. There is nothing in life to grieve for,
      save, indeed, Signor Zanoni, when some young beauty, on whom we have set
      our hearts, slips from our grasp. In such a moment we have need of all our
      wisdom, not to succumb to despair, and shake hands with death. What say
      you, signor? You smile! Such never could be your lot. Pledge me in a
      sentiment, &lsquo;Long life to the fortunate lover,&mdash;a quick release to the
      baffled suitor&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pledge you,&rdquo; said Zanoni; and, as the fatal wine was poured into his
      glass, he repeated, fixing his eyes on the prince, &ldquo;I pledge you even in
      this wine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted the glass to his lips. The prince seemed ghastly pale, while the
      gaze of his guest bent upon him, with an intent and stern brightness,
      beneath which the conscience-stricken host cowered and quailed. Not till
      he had drained his draft, and replaced the glass upon the board, did
      Zanoni turn his eyes from the prince; and he then said, &ldquo;Your wine has
      been kept too long; it has lost its virtues. It might disagree with many,
      but do not fear: it will not harm me, prince, Signor Mascari, you are a
      judge of the grape; will you favour us with your opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; answered Mascari, with well-affected composure, &ldquo;I like not the
      wines of Cyprus; they are heating. Perhaps Signor Glyndon may not have the
      same distaste? The English are said to love their potations warm and
      pungent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish my friend also to taste the wine, prince?&rdquo; said Zanoni.
      &ldquo;Recollect, all cannot drink it with the same impunity as myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the prince, hastily; &ldquo;if you do not recommend the wine, Heaven
      forbid that we should constrain our guests! My lord duke,&rdquo; turning to one
      of the Frenchmen, &ldquo;yours is the true soil of Bacchus. What think you of
      this cask from Burgundy? Has it borne the journey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Zanoni, &ldquo;let us change both the wine and the theme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that, Zanoni grew yet more animated and brilliant. Never did wit more
      sparkling, airy, exhilarating, flash from the lips of reveller. His
      spirits fascinated all present&mdash;even the prince himself, even Glyndon&mdash;with
      a strange and wild contagion. The former, indeed, whom the words and gaze
      of Zanoni, when he drained the poison, had filled with fearful misgivings,
      now hailed in the brilliant eloquence of his wit a certain sign of the
      operation of the bane. The wine circulated fast; but none seemed conscious
      of its effects. One by one the rest of the party fell into a charmed and
      spellbound silence, as Zanoni continued to pour forth sally upon sally,
      tale upon tale. They hung on his words, they almost held their breath to
      listen. Yet, how bitter was his mirth; how full of contempt for the
      triflers present, and for the trifles which made their life!
    </p>
    <p>
      Night came on; the room grew dim, and the feast had lasted several hours
      longer than was the customary duration of similar entertainments at that
      day. Still the guests stirred not, and still Zanoni continued, with
      glittering eye and mocking lip, to lavish his stores of intellect and
      anecdote; when suddenly the moon rose, and shed its rays over the flowers
      and fountains in the court without, leaving the room itself half in
      shadow, and half tinged by a quiet and ghostly light.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that Zanoni rose. &ldquo;Well, gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we have not yet
      wearied our host, I hope; and his garden offers a new temptation to
      protract our stay. Have you no musicians among your train, prince, that
      might regale our ears while we inhale the fragrance of your orange-trees?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An excellent thought!&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;Mascari, see to the music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The party rose simultaneously to adjourn to the garden; and then, for the
      first time, the effect of the wine they had drunk seemed to make itself
      felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      With flushed cheeks and unsteady steps they came into the open air, which
      tended yet more to stimulate that glowing fever of the grape. As if to
      make up for the silence with which the guests had hitherto listened to
      Zanoni, every tongue was now loosened,&mdash;every man talked, no man
      listened. There was something wild and fearful in the contrast between the
      calm beauty of the night and scene, and the hubbub and clamour of these
      disorderly roysters. One of the Frenchmen, in especial, the young Duc de R&mdash;,
      a nobleman of the highest rank, and of all the quick, vivacious, and
      irascible temperament of his countrymen, was particularly noisy and
      excited. And as circumstances, the remembrance of which is still preserved
      among certain circles of Naples, rendered it afterwards necessary that the
      duc should himself give evidence of what occurred, I will here translate
      the short account he drew up, and which was kindly submitted to me some
      few years ago by my accomplished and lively friend, Il Cavaliere di B&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never remember,&rdquo; writes the duc, &ldquo;to have felt my spirits so excited as
      on that evening; we were like so many boys released from school, jostling
      each other as we reeled or ran down the flight of seven or eight stairs
      that led from the colonnade into the garden,&mdash;some laughing, some
      whooping, some scolding, some babbling. The wine had brought out, as it
      were, each man&rsquo;s inmost character. Some were loud and quarrelsome, others
      sentimental and whining; some, whom we had hitherto thought dull, most
      mirthful; some, whom we had ever regarded as discreet and taciturn, most
      garrulous and uproarious. I remember that in the midst of our clamorous
      gayety, my eye fell upon the cavalier Signor Zanoni, whose conversation
      had so enchanted us all; and I felt a certain chill come over me to
      perceive that he wore the same calm and unsympathising smile upon his
      countenance which had characterised it in his singular and curious stories
      of the court of Louis XIV. I felt, indeed, half-inclined to seek a quarrel
      with one whose composure was almost an insult to our disorder. Nor was
      such an effect of this irritating and mocking tranquillity confined to
      myself alone. Several of the party have told me since, that on looking at
      Zanoni they felt their blood yet more heated, and gayety change to
      resentment. There seemed in his icy smile a very charm to wound vanity and
      provoke rage. It was at this moment that the prince came up to me, and,
      passing his arm into mine, led me a little apart from the rest. He had
      certainly indulged in the same excess as ourselves, but it did not produce
      the same effect of noisy excitement. There was, on the contrary, a certain
      cold arrogance and supercilious scorn in his bearing and language, which,
      even while affecting so much caressing courtesy towards me, roused my
      self-love against him. He seemed as if Zanoni had infected him; and in
      imitating the manner of his guest, he surpassed the original. He rallied
      me on some court gossip, which had honoured my name by associating it with
      a certain beautiful and distinguished Sicilian lady, and affected to treat
      with contempt that which, had it been true, I should have regarded as a
      boast. He spoke, indeed, as if he himself had gathered all the flowers of
      Naples, and left us foreigners only the gleanings he had scorned. At this
      my natural and national gallantry was piqued, and I retorted by some
      sarcasms that I should certainly have spared had my blood been cooler. He
      laughed heartily, and left me in a strange fit of resentment and anger.
      Perhaps (I must own the truth) the wine had produced in me a wild
      disposition to take offence and provoke quarrel. As the prince left me, I
      turned, and saw Zanoni at my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The prince is a braggart,&rsquo; said he, with the same smile that displeased
      me before. &lsquo;He would monopolize all fortune and all love. Let us take our
      revenge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And how?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He has at this moment, in his house, the most enchanting singer in
      Naples,&mdash;the celebrated Viola Pisani. She is here, it is true, not by
      her own choice; he carried her hither by force, but he will pretend that
      she adores him. Let us insist on his producing this secret treasure, and
      when she enters, the Duc de R&mdash; can have no doubt that his flatteries
      and attentions will charm the lady, and provoke all the jealous fears of
      our host. It would be a fair revenge upon his imperious self-conceit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This suggestion delighted me. I hastened to the prince. At that instant
      the musicians had just commenced; I waved my hand, ordered the music to
      stop, and, addressing the prince, who was standing in the centre of one of
      the gayest groups, complained of his want of hospitality in affording to
      us such poor proficients in the art, while he reserved for his own solace
      the lute and voice of the first performer in Naples. I demanded,
      half-laughingly, half-seriously, that he should produce the Pisani. My
      demand was received with shouts of applause by the rest. We drowned the
      replies of our host with uproar, and would hear no denial. &lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; at
      last said the prince, when he could obtain an audience, &lsquo;even were I to
      assent to your proposal, I could not induce the signora to present herself
      before an assemblage as riotous as they are noble. You have too much
      chivalry to use compulsion with her, though the Duc de R&mdash;forgets
      himself sufficiently to administer it to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was stung by this taunt, however well deserved. &lsquo;Prince,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I
      have for the indelicacy of compulsion so illustrious an example that I
      cannot hesitate to pursue the path honoured by your own footsteps. All
      Naples knows that the Pisani despises at once your gold and your love;
      that force alone could have brought her under your roof; and that you
      refuse to produce her, because you fear her complaints, and know enough of
      the chivalry your vanity sneers at to feel assured that the gentlemen of
      France are not more disposed to worship beauty than to defend it from
      wrong.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You speak well, sir,&rsquo; said Zanoni, gravely. &lsquo;The prince dares not
      produce his prize!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prince remained speechless for a few moments, as if with indignation.
      At last he broke out into expressions the most injurious and insulting
      against Signor Zanoni and myself. Zanoni replied not; I was more hot and
      hasty. The guests appeared to delight in our dispute. None, except
      Mascari, whom we pushed aside and disdained to hear, strove to conciliate;
      some took one side, some another. The issue may be well foreseen. Swords
      were called for and procured. Two were offered me by one of the party. I
      was about to choose one, when Zanoni placed in my hand the other, which,
      from its hilt, appeared of antiquated workmanship. At the same moment,
      looking towards the prince, he said, smilingly, &lsquo;The duc takes your
      grandsire&rsquo;s sword. Prince, you are too brave a man for superstition; you
      have forgot the forfeit!&rsquo; Our host seemed to me to recoil and turn pale at
      those words; nevertheless, he returned Zanoni&rsquo;s smile with a look of
      defiance. The next moment all was broil and disorder. There might be some
      six or eight persons engaged in a strange and confused kind of melee, but
      the prince and myself only sought each other. The noise around us, the
      confusion of the guests, the cries of the musicians, the clash of our own
      swords, only served to stimulate our unhappy fury. We feared to be
      interrupted by the attendants, and fought like madmen, without skill or
      method. I thrust and parried mechanically, blind and frantic, as if a
      demon had entered into me, till I saw the prince stretched at my feet,
      bathed in his blood, and Zanoni bending over him, and whispering in his
      ear. That sight cooled us all. The strife ceased; we gathered, in shame,
      remorse, and horror, round our ill-fated host; but it was too late,&mdash;his
      eyes rolled fearfully in his head. I have seen many men die, but never one
      who wore such horror on his countenance. At last all was over! Zanoni rose
      from the corpse, and, taking, with great composure, the sword from my
      hand, said calmly, &lsquo;Ye are witnesses, gentlemen, that the prince brought
      his fate upon himself. The last of that illustrious house has perished in
      a brawl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw no more of Zanoni. I hastened to our envoy to narrate the event,
      and abide the issue. I am grateful to the Neapolitan government, and to
      the illustrious heir of the unfortunate nobleman, for the lenient and
      generous, yet just, interpretation put upon a misfortune the memory of
      which will afflict me to the last hour of my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Signed) &ldquo;Louis Victor, Duc de R.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the above memorial, the reader will find the most exact and minute
      account yet given of an event which created the most lively sensation at
      Naples in that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon had taken no part in the affray, neither had he participated
      largely in the excesses of the revel. For his exemption from both he was
      perhaps indebted to the whispered exhortations of Zanoni. When the last
      rose from the corpse, and withdrew from that scene of confusion, Glyndon
      remarked that in passing the crowd he touched Mascari on the shoulder, and
      said something which the Englishman did not overhear. Glyndon followed
      Zanoni into the banquet-room, which, save where the moonlight slept on the
      marble floor, was wrapped in the sad and gloomy shadows of the advancing
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you foretell this fearful event? He fell not by your arm!&rdquo; said
      Glyndon, in a tremulous and hollow tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The general who calculates on the victory does not fight in person,&rdquo;
       answered Zanoni; &ldquo;let the past sleep with the dead. Meet me at midnight by
      the sea-shore, half a mile to the left of your hotel. You will know the
      spot by a rude pillar&mdash;the only one near&mdash;to which a broken
      chain is attached. There and then, if thou wouldst learn our lore, thou
      shalt find the master. Go; I have business here yet. Remember, Viola is
      still in the house of the dead man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Mascari approached, and Zanoni, turning to the Italian, and waving
      his hand to Glyndon, drew the former aside. Glyndon slowly departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mascari,&rdquo; said Zanoni, &ldquo;your patron is no more; your services will be
      valueless to his heir,&mdash;a sober man whom poverty has preserved from
      vice. For yourself, thank me that I do not give you up to the executioner;
      recollect the wine of Cyprus. Well, never tremble, man; it could not act
      on me, though it might react on others; in that it is a common type of
      crime. I forgive you; and if the wine should kill me, I promise you that
      my ghost shall not haunt so worshipful a penitent. Enough of this; conduct
      me to the chamber of Viola Pisani. You have no further need of her. The
      death of the jailer opens the cell of the captive. Be quick; I would be
      gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mascari muttered some inaudible words, bowed low, and led the way to the
      chamber in which Viola was confined.

    <p>
      It wanted several minutes of midnight, and Glyndon repaired to the
      appointed spot. The mysterious empire which Zanoni had acquired over him,
      was still more solemnly confirmed by the events of the last few hours; the
      sudden fate of the prince, so deliberately foreshadowed, and yet so
      seemingly accidental, brought out by causes the most commonplace, and yet
      associated with words the most prophetic, impressed him with the deepest
      sentiments of admiration and awe. It was as if this dark and wondrous
      being could convert the most ordinary events and the meanest instruments
      into the agencies of his inscrutable will; yet, if so, why have permitted
      the capture of Viola? Why not have prevented the crime rather than punish
      the criminal? And did Zanoni really feel love for Viola? Love, and yet
      offer to resign her to himself,&mdash;to a rival whom his arts could not
      have failed to baffle. He no longer reverted to the belief that Zanoni or
      Viola had sought to dupe him into marriage. His fear and reverence for the
      former now forbade the notion of so poor an imposture. Did he any longer
      love Viola himself? No; when that morning he had heard of her danger, he
      had, it is true, returned to the sympathies and the fears of affection;
      but with the death of the prince her image faded from his heart, and he
      felt no jealous pang at the thought that she had been saved by Zanoni,&mdash;that
      at that moment she was perhaps beneath his roof. Whoever has, in the
      course of his life, indulged the absorbing passion of the gamester, will
      remember how all other pursuits and objects vanished from his mind; how
      solely he was wrapped in the one wild delusion; with what a sceptre of
      magic power the despot-demon ruled every feeling and every thought. Far
      more intense than the passion of the gamester was the frantic yet sublime
      desire that mastered the breast of Glyndon. He would be the rival of
      Zanoni, not in human and perishable affections, but in preternatural and
      eternal lore. He would have laid down life with content&mdash;nay, rapture&mdash;as
      the price of learning those solemn secrets which separated the stranger
      from mankind. Enamoured of the goddess of goddesses, he stretched forth
      his arms&mdash;the wild Ixion&mdash;and embraced a cloud!
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was most lovely and serene, and the waves scarcely rippled at
      his feet as the Englishman glided on by the cool and starry beach. At
      length he arrived at the spot, and there, leaning against the broken
      pillar, he beheld a man wrapped in a long mantle, and in an attitude of
      profound repose. He approached, and uttered the name of Zanoni. The figure
      turned, and he saw the face of a stranger: a face not stamped by the
      glorious beauty of Zanoni, but equally majestic in its aspect, and perhaps
      still more impressive from the mature age and the passionless depth of
      thought that characterised the expanded forehead, and deep-set but
      piercing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seek Zanoni,&rdquo; said the stranger; &ldquo;he will be here anon; but, perhaps,
      he whom you see before you is more connected with your destiny, and more
      disposed to realise your dreams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hath the earth, then, another Zanoni?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If not,&rdquo; replied the stranger, &ldquo;why do you cherish the hope and the wild
      faith to be yourself a Zanoni? Think you that none others have burned with
      the same godlike dream? Who, indeed in his first youth,&mdash;youth when
      the soul is nearer to the heaven from which it sprang, and its divine and
      primal longings are not all effaced by the sordid passions and petty cares
      that are begot in time,&mdash;who is there in youth that has not nourished
      the belief that the universe has secrets not known to the common herd, and
      panted, as the hart for the water-springs, for the fountains that lie hid
      and far away amidst the broad wilderness of trackless science? The music
      of the fountain is heard in the soul WITHIN, till the steps, deceived and
      erring, rove away from its waters, and the wanderer dies in the mighty
      desert. Think you that none who have cherished the hope have found the
      truth, or that the yearning after the Ineffable Knowledge was given to us
      utterly in vain? No! Every desire in human hearts is but a glimpse of
      things that exist, alike distant and divine. No! in the world there have
      been from age to age some brighter and happier spirits who have attained
      to the air in which the beings above mankind move and breathe. Zanoni,
      great though he be, stands not alone. He has had his predecessors, and
      long lines of successors may be yet to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you tell me,&rdquo; said Glyndon, &ldquo;that in yourself I behold one of
      that mighty few over whom Zanoni has no superiority in power and wisdom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In me,&rdquo; answered the stranger, &ldquo;you see one from whom Zanoni himself
      learned some of his loftiest secrets. On these shores, on this spot, have
      I stood in ages that your chroniclers but feebly reach. The Phoenician,
      the Greek, the Oscan, the Roman, the Lombard, I have seen them all!&mdash;leaves
      gay and glittering on the trunk of the universal life, scattered in due
      season and again renewed; till, indeed, the same race that gave its glory
      to the ancient world bestowed a second youth upon the new. For the pure
      Greeks, the Hellenes, whose origin has bewildered your dreaming scholars,
      were of the same great family as the Norman tribe, born to be the lords of
      the universe, and in no land on earth destined to become the hewers of
      wood. Even the dim traditions of the learned, which bring the sons of
      Hellas from the vast and undetermined territories of Northern Thrace, to
      be the victors of the pastoral Pelasgi, and the founders of the line of
      demi-gods; which assign to a population bronzed beneath the suns of the
      West, the blue-eyed Minerva and the yellow-haired Achilles (physical
      characteristics of the North); which introduce, amongst a pastoral people,
      warlike aristocracies and limited monarchies, the feudalism of the classic
      time,&mdash;even these might serve you to trace back the primeval
      settlements of the Hellenes to the same region whence, in later times, the
      Norman warriors broke on the dull and savage hordes of the Celt, and
      became the Greeks of the Christian world. But this interests you not, and
      you are wise in your indifference. Not in the knowledge of things without,
      but in the perfection of the soul within, lies the empire of man aspiring
      to be more than man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what books contain that science; from what laboratory is it wrought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nature supplies the materials; they are around you in your daily walks.
      In the herbs that the beast devours and the chemist disdains to cull; in
      the elements from which matter in its meanest and its mightiest shapes is
      deduced; in the wide bosom of the air; in the black abysses of the earth;
      everywhere are given to mortals the resources and libraries of immortal
      lore. But as the simplest problems in the simplest of all studies are
      obscure to one who braces not his mind to their comprehension; as the
      rower in yonder vessel cannot tell you why two circles can touch each
      other only in one point,&mdash;so though all earth were carved over and
      inscribed with the letters of diviner knowledge, the characters would be
      valueless to him who does not pause to inquire the language and meditate
      the truth. Young man, if thy imagination is vivid, if thy heart is daring,
      if thy curiosity is insatiate, I will accept thee as my pupil. But the
      first lessons are stern and dread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If thou hast mastered them, why not I?&rdquo; answered Glyndon, boldly. &ldquo;I have
      felt from my boyhood that strange mysteries were reserved for my career;
      and from the proudest ends of ordinary ambition I have carried my gaze
      into the cloud and darkness that stretch beyond. The instant I beheld
      Zanoni, I felt as if I had discovered the guide and the tutor for which my
      youth had idly languished and vainly burned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to me his duty is transferred,&rdquo; replied the stranger. &ldquo;Yonder lies,
      anchored in the bay, the vessel in which Zanoni seeks a fairer home; a
      little while and the breeze will rise, the sail will swell; and the
      stranger will have passed, like a wind, away. Still, like the wind, he
      leaves in thy heart the seeds that may bear the blossom and the fruit.
      Zanoni hath performed his task,&mdash;he is wanted no more; the perfecter
      of his work is at thy side. He comes! I hear the dash of the oar. You will
      have your choice submitted to you. According as you decide we shall meet
      again.&rdquo; With these words the stranger moved slowly away, and disappeared
      beneath the shadow of the cliffs. A boat glided rapidly across the waters:
      it touched land; a man leaped on shore, and Glyndon recognised Zanoni.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give thee, Glyndon,&mdash;I give thee no more the option of happy love
      and serene enjoyment. That hour is past, and fate has linked the hand that
      might have been thine own to mine. But I have ample gifts to bestow upon
      thee, if thou wilt abandon the hope that gnaws thy heart, and the
      realisation of which even <i>I</i> have not the power to foresee. Be thine
      ambition human, and I can gratify it to the full. Men desire four things
      in life,&mdash;love, wealth, fame, power. The first I cannot give thee,
      the rest are at my disposal. Select which of them thou wilt, and let us
      part in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such are not the gifts I covet. I choose knowledge; that knowledge must
      be thine own. For this, and for this alone, I surrendered the love of
      Viola; this, and this alone, must be my recompense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot gain say thee, though I can warn. The desire to learn does not
      always contain the faculty to acquire. I can give thee, it is true, the
      teacher,&mdash;the rest must depend on thee. Be wise in time, and take
      that which I can assure to thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me but these questions, and according to your answer I will
      decide. Is it in the power of man to attain intercourse with the beings of
      other worlds? Is it in the power of man to influence the elements, and to
      insure life against the sword and against disease?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this may be possible,&rdquo; answered Zanoni, evasively, &ldquo;to the few; but
      for one who attains such secrets, millions may perish in the attempt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One question more. Thou&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beware! Of myself, as I have said before, I render no account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, the stranger I have met this night,&mdash;are his boasts to
      be believed? Is he in truth one of the chosen seers whom you allow to have
      mastered the mysteries I yearn to fathom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rash man,&rdquo; said Zanoni, in a tone of compassion, &ldquo;thy crisis is past, and
      thy choice made! I can only bid thee be bold and prosper; yes, I resign
      thee to a master who HAS the power and the will to open to thee the gates
      of an awful world. Thy weal or woe are as nought in the eyes of his
      relentless wisdom. I would bid him spare thee, but he will heed me not.
      Mejnour, receive thy pupil!&rdquo; Glyndon turned, and his heart beat when he
      perceived that the stranger, whose footsteps he had not heard upon the
      pebbles, whose approach he had not beheld in the moonlight, was once more
      by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; resumed Zanoni; &ldquo;thy trial commences. When next we meet, thou
      wilt be the victim or the victor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon&rsquo;s eyes followed the receding form of the mysterious stranger. He
      saw him enter the boat, and he then for the first time noticed that
      besides the rowers there was a female, who stood up as Zanoni gained the
      boat. Even at the distance he recognised the once-adored form of Viola.
      She waved her hand to him, and across the still and shining air came her
      voice, mournfully and sweetly, in her mother&rsquo;s tongue, &ldquo;Farewell,
      Clarence,&mdash;I forgive thee!&mdash;farewell, farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He strove to answer; but the voice touched a chord at his heart, and the
      words failed him. Viola was then lost forever, gone with this dread
      stranger; darkness was round her lot! And he himself had decided her fate
      and his own! The boat bounded on, the soft waves flashed and sparkled
      beneath the oars, and it was along one sapphire track of moonlight that
      the frail vessel bore away the lovers. Farther and farther from his gaze
      sped the boat, till at last the speck, scarcely visible, touched the side
      of the ship that lay lifeless in the glorious bay. At that instant, as if
      by magic, up sprang, with a glad murmur, the playful and freshening wind:
      and Glyndon turned to Mejnour and broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me&mdash;if thou canst read the future&mdash;tell me that HER lot
      will be fair, and that HER choice at least is wise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My pupil!&rdquo; answered Mejnour, in a voice the calmness of which well
      accorded with the chilling words, &ldquo;thy first task must be to withdraw all
      thought, feeling, sympathy from others. The elementary stage of knowledge
      is to make self, and self alone, thy study and thy world. Thou hast
      decided thine own career; thou hast renounced love; thou hast rejected
      wealth, fame, and the vulgar pomps of power. What, then, are all mankind
      to thee? To perfect thy faculties, and concentrate thy emotions, is
      henceforth thy only aim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will happiness be the end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If happiness exist,&rdquo; answered Mejnour, &ldquo;it must be centred in a SELF to
      which all passion is unknown. But happiness is the last state of being;
      and as yet thou art on the threshold of the first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Mejnour spoke, the distant vessel spread its sails to the wind, and
      moved slowly along the deep. Glyndon sighed, and the pupil and the master
      retraced their steps towards the city.

</pre>
    <p>
      It was about a month after the date of Zanoni&rsquo;s departure and Glyndon&rsquo;s
      introduction to Mejnour, when two Englishmen were walking, arm-in-arm,
      through the Toledo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; said one (who spoke warmly), &ldquo;that if you have a particle of
      common-sense left in you, you will accompany me to England. This Mejnour
      is an imposter more dangerous, because more in earnest, than Zanoni. After
      all, what do his promises amount to? You allow that nothing can be more
      equivocal. You say that he has left Naples,&mdash;that he has selected a
      retreat more congenial than the crowded thoroughfares of men to the
      studies in which he is to initiate you; and this retreat is among the
      haunts of the fiercest bandits of Italy,&mdash;haunts which justice itself
      dares not penetrate. Fitting hermitage for a sage! I tremble for you. What
      if this stranger&mdash;of whom nothing is known&mdash;be leagued with the
      robbers; and these lures for your credulity bait but the traps for your
      property,&mdash;perhaps your life? You might come off cheaply by a ransom
      of half your fortune. You smile indignantly! Well, put common-sense out of
      the question; take your own view of the matter. You are to undergo an
      ordeal which Mejnour himself does not profess to describe as a very
      tempting one. It may, or it may not, succeed: if it does not, you are
      menaced with the darkest evils; and if it does, you cannot be better off
      than the dull and joyless mystic whom you have taken for a master. Away
      with this folly; enjoy youth while it is left to you; return with me to
      England; forget these dreams; enter your proper career; form affections
      more respectable than those which lured you awhile to an Italian
      adventuress. Attend to your fortune, make money, and become a happy and
      distinguished man. This is the advice of sober friendship; yet the
      promises I hold out to you are fairer than those of Mejnour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mervale,&rdquo; said Glyndon, doggedly, &ldquo;I cannot, if I would, yield to your
      wishes. A power that is above me urges me on; I cannot resist its
      influence. I will proceed to the last in the strange career I have
      commenced. Think of me no more. Follow yourself the advice you give to me,
      and be happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is madness,&rdquo; said Mervale; &ldquo;your health is already failing; you are
      so changed I should scarcely know you. Come; I have already had your name
      entered in my passport; in another hour I shall be gone, and you, boy that
      you are, will be left, without a friend, to the deceits of your own fancy
      and the machinations of this relentless mountebank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; said Glyndon, coldly; &ldquo;you cease to be an effective counsellor
      when you suffer your prejudices to be thus evident. I have already had
      ample proof,&rdquo; added the Englishman, and his pale cheek grew more pale, &ldquo;of
      the power of this man,&mdash;if man he be, which I sometimes doubt,&mdash;and,
      come life, come death, I will not shrink from the paths that allure me.
      Farewell, Mervale; if we never meet again,&mdash;if you hear, amidst our
      old and cheerful haunts, that Clarence Glyndon sleeps the last sleep by
      the shores of Naples, or amidst yon distant hills, say to the friends of
      our youth, &lsquo;He died worthily, as thousands of martyr-students have died
      before him, in the pursuit of knowledge.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wrung Mervale&rsquo;s hand as he spoke, darted from his side, and disappeared
      amidst the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the corner of the Toledo he was arrested by Nicot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Glyndon! I have not seen you this month. Where have you hid yourself?
      Have you been absorbed in your studies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am about to leave Naples for Paris. Will you accompany me? Talent of
      all order is eagerly sought for there, and will be sure to rise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you; I have other schemes for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So laconic!&mdash;what ails you? Do you grieve for the loss of the
      Pisani? Take example by me. I have already consoled myself with Bianca
      Sacchini,&mdash;a handsome woman, enlightened, no prejudices. A valuable
      creature I shall find her, no doubt. But as for this Zanoni!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ever I paint an allegorical subject, I will take his likeness as
      Satan. Ha, ha! a true painter&rsquo;s revenge,&mdash;eh? And the way of the
      world, too! When we can do nothing else against a man whom we hate, we can
      at least paint his effigies as the Devil&rsquo;s. Seriously, though: I abhor
      that man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wherefore?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wherefore! Has he not carried off the wife and the dowry I had marked for
      myself! Yet, after all,&rdquo; added Nicot, musingly, &ldquo;had he served instead of
      injured me, I should have hated him all the same. His very form, and his
      very face, made me at once envy and detest him. I felt that there is
      something antipathetic in our natures. I feel, too, that we shall meet
      again, when Jean Nicot&rsquo;s hate may be less impotent. We, too, cher
      confrere,&mdash;we, too, may meet again! Vive la Republique! I to my new
      world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I to mine. Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That day Mervale left Naples; the next morning Glyndon also quitted the
      City of Delight alone, and on horseback. He bent his way into those
      picturesque but dangerous parts of the country which at that time were
      infested by banditti, and which few travellers dared to pass, even in
      broad daylight, without a strong escort. A road more lonely cannot well be
      conceived than that on which the hoofs of his steed, striking upon the
      fragments of rock that encumbered the neglected way, woke a dull and
      melancholy echo. Large tracts of waste land, varied by the rank and
      profuse foliage of the South, lay before him; occasionally a wild goat
      peeped down from some rocky crag, or the discordant cry of a bird of prey,
      startled in its sombre haunt, was heard above the hills. These were the
      only signs of life; not a human being was met,&mdash;not a hut was
      visible. Wrapped in his own ardent and solemn thoughts, the young man
      continued his way, till the sun had spent its noonday heat, and a breeze
      that announced the approach of eve sprung up from the unseen ocean which
      lay far distant to his right. It was then that a turn in the road brought
      before him one of those long, desolate, gloomy villages which are found in
      the interior of the Neapolitan dominions: and now he came upon a small
      chapel on one side the road, with a gaudily painted image of the Virgin in
      the open shrine. Around this spot, which, in the heart of a Christian
      land, retained the vestige of the old idolatry (for just such were the
      chapels that in the pagan age were dedicated to the demon-saints of
      mythology), gathered six or seven miserable and squalid wretches, whom the
      curse of the leper had cut off from mankind. They set up a shrill cry as
      they turned their ghastly visages towards the horseman; and, without
      stirring from the spot, stretched out their gaunt arms, and implored
      charity in the name of the Merciful Mother! Glyndon hastily threw them
      some small coins, and, turning away his face, clapped spurs to his horse,
      and relaxed not his speed till he entered the village. On either side the
      narrow and miry street, fierce and haggard forms&mdash;some leaning
      against the ruined walls of blackened huts, some seated at the threshold,
      some lying at full length in the mud&mdash;presented groups that at once
      invoked pity and aroused alarm: pity for their squalor, alarm for the
      ferocity imprinted on their savage aspects. They gazed at him, grim and
      sullen, as he rode slowly up the rugged street; sometimes whispering
      significantly to each other, but without attempting to stop his way. Even
      the children hushed their babble, and ragged urchins, devouring him with
      sparkling eyes, muttered to their mothers; &ldquo;We shall feast well
      to-morrow!&rdquo; It was, indeed, one of those hamlets in which Law sets not its
      sober step, in which Violence and Murder house secure,&mdash;hamlets
      common then in the wilder parts of Italy, in which the peasant was but the
      gentler name for the robber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon&rsquo;s heart somewhat failed him as he looked around, and the question
      he desired to ask died upon his lips. At length from one of the dismal
      cabins emerged a form superior to the rest. Instead of the patched and
      ragged over-all, which made the only garment of the men he had hitherto
      seen, the dress of this person was characterised by all the trappings of
      the national bravery. Upon his raven hair, the glossy curls of which made
      a notable contrast to the matted and elfin locks of the savages around,
      was placed a cloth cap, with a gold tassel that hung down to his shoulder;
      his mustaches were trimmed with care, and a silk kerchief of gay hues was
      twisted round a well-shaped but sinewy throat; a short jacket of rough
      cloth was decorated with several rows of gilt filagree buttons; his nether
      garments fitted tight to his limbs, and were curiously braided; while in a
      broad parti-coloured sash were placed two silver-hilted pistols, and the
      sheathed knife, usually worn by Italians of the lower order, mounted in
      ivory elaborately carved. A small carbine of handsome workmanship was
      slung across his shoulder and completed his costume. The man himself was
      of middle size, athletic yet slender, with straight and regular features,
      sunburnt, but not swarthy; and an expression of countenance which, though
      reckless and bold, had in it frankness rather than ferocity, and, if
      defying, was not altogether unprepossessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon, after eyeing this figure for some moments with great attention,
      checked his rein, and asked the way to the &ldquo;Castle of the Mountain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man lifted his cap as he heard the question, and, approaching Glyndon,
      laid his hand upon the neck of the horse, and said, in a low voice, &ldquo;Then
      you are the cavalier whom our patron the signor expected. He bade me wait
      for you here, and lead you to the castle. And indeed, signor, it might
      have been unfortunate if I had neglected to obey the command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man then, drawing a little aside, called out to the bystanders in a
      loud voice, &ldquo;Ho, ho! my friends, pay henceforth and forever all respect to
      this worshipful cavalier. He is the expected guest of our blessed patron
      of the Castle of the Mountain. Long life to him! May he, like his host, be
      safe by day and by night; on the hill and in the waste; against the dagger
      and the bullet,&mdash;in limb and in life! Cursed be he who touches a hair
      of his head, or a baioccho in his pouch. Now and forever we will protect
      and honour him,&mdash;for the law or against the law; with the faith and
      to the death. Amen! Amen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; responded, in wild chorus, a hundred voices; and the scattered and
      straggling groups pressed up the street, nearer and nearer to the
      horseman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that he may be known,&rdquo; continued the Englishman&rsquo;s strange protector,
      &ldquo;to the eye and to the ear, I place around him the white sash, and I give
      him the sacred watchword, &lsquo;Peace to the Brave.&rsquo; Signor, when you wear this
      sash, the proudest in these parts will bare the head and bend the knee.
      Signor, when you utter this watchword, the bravest hearts will be bound to
      your bidding. Desire you safety, or ask you revenge&mdash;to gain a
      beauty, or to lose a foe,&mdash;speak but the word, and we are yours: we
      are yours! Is it not so, comrades?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And again the hoarse voices shouted, &ldquo;Amen, Amen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, signor,&rdquo; whispered the bravo, &ldquo;if you have a few coins to spare,
      scatter them amongst the crowd, and let us be gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon, not displeased at the concluding sentence, emptied his purse in
      the streets; and while, with mingled oaths, blessings, shrieks, and yells,
      men, women, and children scrambled for the money, the bravo, taking the
      rein of the horse, led it a few paces through the village at a brisk trot,
      and then, turning up a narrow lane to the left, in a few minutes neither
      houses nor men were visible, and the mountains closed their path on either
      side. It was then that, releasing the bridle and slackening his pace, the
      guide turned his dark eyes on Glyndon with an arch expression, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Excellency was not, perhaps, prepared for the hearty welcome we have
      given you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, in truth, I OUGHT to have been prepared for it, since the signor, to
      whose house I am bound, did not disguise from me the character of the
      neighbourhood. And your name, my friend, if I may so call you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no ceremonies with me, Excellency. In the village I am generally
      called Maestro Paolo. I had a surname once, though a very equivocal one;
      and I have forgotten THAT since I retired from the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was it from disgust, from poverty, or from some&mdash;some ebullition
      of passion which entailed punishment, that you betook yourself to the
      mountains?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, signor,&rdquo; said the bravo, with a gay laugh, &ldquo;hermits of my class
      seldom love the confessional. However, I have no secrets while my step is
      in these defiles, my whistle in my pouch, and my carbine at my back.&rdquo; With
      that the robber, as if he loved permission to talk at his will, hemmed
      thrice, and began with much humour; though, as his tale proceeded, the
      memories it roused seemed to carry him farther than he at first intended,
      and reckless and light-hearted ease gave way to that fierce and varied
      play of countenance and passion of gesture which characterise the emotions
      of his countrymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was born at Terracina,&mdash;a fair spot, is it not? My father was a
      learned monk of high birth; my mother&mdash;Heaven rest her!&mdash;an
      innkeeper&rsquo;s pretty daughter. Of course there could be no marriage in the
      case; and when I was born, the monk gravely declared my appearance to be
      miraculous. I was dedicated from my cradle to the altar; and my head was
      universally declared to be the orthodox shape for a cowl. As I grew up,
      the monk took great pains with my education; and I learned Latin and
      psalmody as soon as less miraculous infants learn crowing. Nor did the
      holy man&rsquo;s care stint itself to my interior accomplishments. Although
      vowed to poverty, he always contrived that my mother should have her
      pockets full; and between her pockets and mine there was soon established
      a clandestine communication; accordingly, at fourteen, I wore my cap on
      one side, stuck pistols in my belt, and assumed the swagger of a cavalier
      and a gallant. At that age my poor mother died; and about the same period
      my father, having written a History of the Pontifical Bulls, in forty
      volumes, and being, as I said, of high birth, obtained a cardinal&rsquo;s hat.
      From that time he thought fit to disown your humble servant. He bound me
      over to an honest notary at Naples, and gave me two hundred crowns by way
      of provision. Well, signor, I saw enough of the law to convince me that I
      should never be rogue enough to shine in the profession. So, instead of
      spoiling parchment, I made love to the notary&rsquo;s daughter. My master
      discovered our innocent amusement, and turned me out of doors; that was
      disagreeable. But my Ninetta loved me, and took care that I should not lie
      out in the streets with the Lazzaroni. Little jade! I think I see her now
      with her bare feet, and her finger to her lips, opening the door in the
      summer nights, and bidding me creep softly into the kitchen, where,
      praised be the saints! a flask and a manchet always awaited the hungry
      amoroso. At last, however, Ninetta grew cold. It is the way of the sex,
      signor. Her father found her an excellent marriage in the person of a
      withered old picture-dealer. She took the spouse, and very properly
      clapped the door in the face of the lover. I was not disheartened,
      Excellency; no, not I. Women are plentiful while we are young. So, without
      a ducat in my pocket or a crust for my teeth, I set out to seek my fortune
      on board of a Spanish merchantman. That was duller work than I expected;
      but luckily we were attacked by a pirate,&mdash;half the crew were
      butchered, the rest captured. I was one of the last: always in luck, you
      see, signor,&mdash;monks&rsquo; sons have a knack that way! The captain of the
      pirates took a fancy to me. &lsquo;Serve with us?&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Too happy,&rsquo; said I.
      Behold me, then, a pirate! O jolly life! how I blessed the old notary for
      turning me out of doors! What feasting, what fighting, what wooing, what
      quarrelling! Sometimes we ran ashore and enjoyed ourselves like princes;
      sometimes we lay in a calm for days together on the loveliest sea that man
      ever traversed. And then, if the breeze rose and a sail came in sight, who
      so merry as we? I passed three years in that charming profession, and
      then, signor, I grew ambitious. I caballed against the captain; I wanted
      his post. One still night we struck the blow. The ship was like a log in
      the sea, no land to be seen from the mast-head, the waves like glass, and
      the moon at its full. Up we rose, thirty of us and more. Up we rose with a
      shout; we poured into the captain&rsquo;s cabin, I at the head. The brave old
      boy had caught the alarm, and there he stood at the doorway, a pistol in
      each hand; and his one eye (he had only one) worse to meet than the
      pistols were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yield!&rsquo; cried I; &lsquo;your life shall be safe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Take that,&rsquo; said he, and whiz went the pistol; but the saints took care
      of their own, and the ball passed by my cheek, and shot the boatswain
      behind me. I closed with the captain, and the other pistol went off
      without mischief in the struggle. Such a fellow he was,&mdash;six feet
      four without his shoes! Over we went, rolling each on the other. Santa
      Maria! no time to get hold of one&rsquo;s knife. Meanwhile all the crew were up,
      some for the captain, some for me,&mdash;clashing and firing, and swearing
      and groaning, and now and then a heavy splash in the sea. Fine supper for
      the sharks that night! At last old Bilboa got uppermost; out flashed his
      knife; down it came, but not in my heart. No! I gave my left arm as a
      shield; and the blade went through to the hilt, with the blood spurting up
      like the rain from a whale&rsquo;s nostril! With the weight of the blow the
      stout fellow came down so that his face touched mine; with my right hand I
      caught him by the throat, turned him over like a lamb, signor, and faith
      it was soon all up with him: the boatswain&rsquo;s brother, a fat Dutchman, ran
      him through with a pike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Old fellow,&rsquo; said I, as he turned his terrible eye to me, &lsquo;I bear you no
      malice, but we must try to get on in the world, you know.&rsquo; The captain
      grinned and gave up the ghost. I went upon deck,&mdash;what a sight!
      Twenty bold fellows stark and cold, and the moon sparkling on the puddles
      of blood as calmly as if it were water. Well, signor, the victory was
      ours, and the ship mine; I ruled merrily enough for six months. We then
      attacked a French ship twice our size; what sport it was! And we had not
      had a good fight so long, we were quite like virgins at it! We got the
      best of it, and won ship and cargo. They wanted to pistol the captain, but
      that was against my laws: so we gagged him, for he scolded as loud as if
      we were married to him; left him and the rest of his crew on board our own
      vessel, which was terribly battered; clapped our black flag on the
      Frenchman&rsquo;s, and set off merrily, with a brisk wind in our favour. But
      luck deserted us on forsaking our own dear old ship. A storm came on, a
      plank struck; several of us escaped in a boat; we had lots of gold with
      us, but no water. For two days and two nights we suffered horribly; but at
      last we ran ashore near a French seaport. Our sorry plight moved
      compassion, and as we had money, we were not suspected,&mdash;people only
      suspect the poor. Here we soon recovered our fatigues, rigged ourselves
      out gayly, and your humble servant was considered as noble a captain as
      ever walked deck. But now, alas! my fate would have it that I should fall
      in love with a silk-mercer&rsquo;s daughter. Ah, how I loved her!&mdash;the
      pretty Clara! Yes, I loved her so well that I was seized with horror at my
      past life! I resolved to repent, to marry her, and settle down into an
      honest man. Accordingly, I summoned my messmates, told them my resolution,
      resigned my command, and persuaded them to depart. They were good fellows,
      engaged with a Dutchman, against whom I heard afterwards they made a
      successful mutiny, but I never saw them more. I had two thousand crowns
      still left; with this sum I obtained the consent of the silk-mercer, and
      it was agreed that I should become a partner in the firm. I need not say
      that no one suspected that I had been so great a man, and I passed for a
      Neapolitan goldsmith&rsquo;s son instead of a cardinal&rsquo;s. I was very happy then,
      signor, very,&mdash;I could not have harmed a fly! Had I married Clara, I
      had been as gentle a mercer as ever handled a measure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bravo paused a moment, and it was easy to see that he felt more than
      his words and tone betokened. &ldquo;Well, well, we must not look back at the
      past too earnestly,&mdash;the sunlight upon it makes one&rsquo;s eyes water. The
      day was fixed for our wedding,&mdash;it approached. On the evening before
      the appointed day, Clara, her mother, her little sister, and myself, were
      walking by the port; and as we looked on the sea, I was telling them old
      gossip-tales of mermaids and sea-serpents, when a red-faced, bottle-nosed
      Frenchman clapped himself right before me, and, placing his spectacles
      very deliberately astride his proboscis, echoed out, &lsquo;Sacre, mille
      tonnerres! this is the damned pirate who boarded the &ldquo;Niobe&rdquo;!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;None of your jests,&rsquo; said I, mildly. &lsquo;Ho, ho!&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t be
      mistaken; help there!&rsquo; and he griped me by the collar. I replied, as you
      may suppose, by laying him in the kennel; but it would not do. The French
      captain had a French lieutenant at his back, whose memory was as good as
      his chief&rsquo;s. A crowd assembled; other sailors came up: the odds were
      against me. I slept that night in prison; and in a few weeks afterwards I
      was sent to the galleys. They spared my life, because the old Frenchman
      politely averred that I had made my crew spare his. You may believe that
      the oar and the chain were not to my taste. I and two others escaped; they
      took to the road, and have, no doubt, been long since broken on the wheel.
      I, soft soul, would not commit another crime to gain my bread, for Clara
      was still at my heart with her sweet eyes; so, limiting my rogueries to
      the theft of a beggar&rsquo;s rags, which I compensated by leaving him my galley
      attire instead, I begged my way to the town where I left Clara. It was a
      clear winter&rsquo;s day when I approached the outskirts of the town. I had no
      fear of detection, for my beard and hair were as good as a mask. Oh,
      Mother of Mercy! there came across my way a funeral procession! There, now
      you know it; I can tell you no more. She had died, perhaps of love, more
      likely of shame. Can you guess how I spent that night?&mdash;I stole a
      pickaxe from a mason&rsquo;s shed, and all alone and unseen, under the frosty
      heavens, I dug the fresh mould from the grave; I lifted the coffin, I
      wrenched the lid, I saw her again&mdash;again! Decay had not touched her.
      She was always pale in life! I could have sworn she lived! It was a
      blessed thing to see her once more, and all alone too! But then, at dawn,
      to give her back to the earth,&mdash;to close the lid, to throw down the
      mould, to hear the pebbles rattle on the coffin: that was dreadful!
      Signor, I never knew before, and I don&rsquo;t wish to think now, how valuable a
      thing human life is. At sunrise I was again a wanderer; but now that Clara
      was gone, my scruples vanished, and again I was at war with my betters. I
      contrived at last, at O&mdash;, to get taken on board a vessel bound to
      Leghorn, working out my passage. From Leghorn I went to Rome, and
      stationed myself at the door of the cardinal&rsquo;s palace. Out he came, his
      gilded coach at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ho, father!&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you know me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Your son,&rsquo; said I, in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cardinal drew back, looked at me earnestly, and mused a moment. &lsquo;All
      men are my sons,&rsquo; quoth he then, very mildly; &lsquo;there is gold for thee! To
      him who begs once, alms are due; to him who begs twice, jails are open.
      Take the hint and molest me no more. Heaven bless thee!&rsquo; With that he got
      into his coach, and drove off to the Vatican. His purse which he had left
      behind was well supplied. I was grateful and contented, and took my way to
      Terracina. I had not long passed the marshes when I saw two horsemen
      approach at a canter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You look poor, friend,&rsquo; said one of them, halting; &lsquo;yet you are strong.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Poor men and strong are both serviceable and dangerous, Signor
      Cavalier.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well said; follow us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I obeyed, and became a bandit. I rose by degrees; and as I have always
      been mild in my calling, and have taken purses without cutting throats, I
      bear an excellent character, and can eat my macaroni at Naples without any
      danger to life and limb. For the last two years I have settled in these
      parts, where I hold sway, and where I have purchased land. I am called a
      farmer, signor; and I myself now only rob for amusement, and to keep my
      hand in. I trust I have satisfied your curiosity. We are within a hundred
      yards of the castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how,&rdquo; asked the Englishman, whose interest had been much excited by
      his companion&rsquo;s narrative,&mdash;&ldquo;and how came you acquainted with my
      host?&mdash;and by what means has he so well conciliated the goodwill of
      yourself and friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maestro Paolo turned his black eyes very gravely towards his questioner.
      &ldquo;Why, signor,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you must surely know more of the foreign cavalier
      with the hard name than I do. All I can say is, that about a fortnight ago
      I chanced to be standing by a booth in the Toledo at Naples, when a
      sober-looking gentleman touched me by the arm, and said, &lsquo;Maestro Paolo, I
      want to make your acquaintance; do me the favour to come into yonder
      tavern, and drink a flask of lacrima.&rsquo; &lsquo;Willingly,&rsquo; said I. So we entered
      the tavern. When we were seated, my new acquaintance thus accosted me:
      &lsquo;The Count d&rsquo;O&mdash; has offered to let me hire his old castle near B&mdash;.
      You know the spot?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Extremely well; no one has inhabited it for a century at least; it is
      half in ruins, signor. A queer place to hire; I hope the rent is not
      heavy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Maestro Paolo,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I am a philosopher, and don&rsquo;t care for
      luxuries. I want a quiet retreat for some scientific experiments. The
      castle will suit me very well, provided you will accept me as a neighbour,
      and place me and my friends under your special protection. I am rich; but
      I shall take nothing to the castle worth robbing. I will pay one rent to
      the count, and another to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With that we soon came to terms; and as the strange signor doubled the
      sum I myself proposed, he is in high favour with all his neighbours. We
      would guard the whole castle against an army. And now, signor, that I have
      been thus frank, be frank with me. Who is this singular cavalier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&mdash;he himself told you, a philosopher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hem! searching for the Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone,&mdash;eh, a bit of a
      magician; afraid of the priests?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely; you have hit it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so; and you are his pupil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you well through it,&rdquo; said the robber, seriously, and crossing
      himself with much devotion; &ldquo;I am not much better than other people, but
      one&rsquo;s soul is one&rsquo;s soul. I do not mind a little honest robbery, or
      knocking a man on the head if need be,&mdash;but to make a bargain with
      the devil! Ah, take care, young gentleman, take care!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not fear,&rdquo; said Glyndon, smiling; &ldquo;my preceptor is too wise and
      too good for such a compact. But here we are, I suppose. A noble ruin,&mdash;a
      glorious prospect!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon paused delightedly, and surveyed the scene before and below with
      the eye of a painter. Insensibly, while listening to the bandit, he had
      wound up a considerable ascent, and now he was upon a broad ledge of rock
      covered with mosses and dwarf shrubs. Between this eminence and another of
      equal height, upon which the castle was built, there was a deep but narrow
      fissure, overgrown with the most profuse foliage, so that the eye could
      not penetrate many yards below the rugged surface of the abyss; but the
      profoundness might be well conjectured by the hoarse, low, monotonous roar
      of waters unseen that rolled below, and the subsequent course of which was
      visible at a distance in a perturbed and rapid stream that intersected the
      waste and desolate valleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the left, the prospect seemed almost boundless,&mdash;the extreme
      clearness of the purple air serving to render distinct the features of a
      range of country that a conqueror of old might have deemed in itself a
      kingdom. Lonely and desolate as the road which Glyndon had passed that day
      had appeared, the landscape now seemed studded with castles, spires, and
      villages. Afar off, Naples gleamed whitely in the last rays of the sun,
      and the rose-tints of the horizon melted into the azure of her glorious
      bay. Yet more remote, and in another part of the prospect, might be
      caught, dim and shadowy, and backed by the darkest foliage, the ruined
      pillars of the ancient Posidonia. There, in the midst of his blackened and
      sterile realms, rose the dismal Mount of Fire; while on the other hand,
      winding through variegated plains, to which distance lent all its magic,
      glittered many and many a stream by which Etruscan and Sybarite, Roman and
      Saracen and Norman had, at intervals of ages, pitched the invading tent.
      All the visions of the past&mdash;the stormy and dazzling histories of
      Southern Italy&mdash;rushed over the artist&rsquo;s mind as he gazed below. And
      then, slowly turning to look behind, he saw the grey and mouldering walls
      of the castle in which he sought the secrets that were to give to hope in
      the future a mightier empire than memory owns in the past. It was one of
      those baronial fortresses with which Italy was studded in the earlier
      middle ages, having but little of the Gothic grace or grandeur which
      belongs to the ecclesiastical architecture of the same time, but rude,
      vast, and menacing, even in decay. A wooden bridge was thrown over the
      chasm, wide enough to admit two horsemen abreast; and the planks trembled
      and gave back a hollow sound as Glyndon urged his jaded steed across.
    </p>
    <p>
      A road which had once been broad and paved with rough flags, but which now
      was half-obliterated by long grass and rank weeds, conducted to the outer
      court of the castle hard by; the gates were open, and half the building in
      this part was dismantled; the ruins partially hid by ivy that was the
      growth of centuries. But on entering the inner court, Glyndon was not
      sorry to notice that there was less appearance of neglect and decay; some
      wild roses gave a smile to the grey walls, and in the centre there was a
      fountain in which the waters still trickled coolly, and with a pleasing
      murmur, from the jaws of a gigantic Triton. Here he was met by Mejnour
      with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome, my friend and pupil,&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;he who seeks for Truth can find
      in these solitudes an immortal Academe.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER 4.II.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     And Abaris, so far from esteeming Pythagoras, who taught these
     things, a necromancer or wizard, rather revered and admired him
     as something divine.&mdash;Iamblich., &ldquo;Vit. Pythag.&rdquo;
  </pre>
    <p>
      The attendants whom Mejnour had engaged for his strange abode were such as
      might suit a philosopher of few wants. An old Armenian whom Glyndon
      recognised as in the mystic&rsquo;s service at Naples, a tall, hard-featured
      woman from the village, recommended by Maestro Paolo, and two long-haired,
      smooth-spoken, but fierce-visaged youths from the same place, and honoured
      by the same sponsorship, constituted the establishment. The rooms used by
      the sage were commodious and weather-proof, with some remains of ancient
      splendour in the faded arras that clothed the walls, and the huge tables
      of costly marble and elaborate carving. Glyndon&rsquo;s sleeping apartment
      communicated with a kind of belvedere, or terrace, that commanded
      prospects of unrivalled beauty and extent, and was separated on the other
      side by a long gallery, and a flight of ten or a dozen stairs, from the
      private chambers of the mystic. There was about the whole place a sombre
      and yet not displeasing depth of repose. It suited well with the studies
      to which it was now to be appropriated.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several days Mejnour refused to confer with Glyndon on the subjects
      nearest to his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All without,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is prepared, but not all within; your own soul
      must grow accustomed to the spot, and filled with the surrounding nature;
      for Nature is the source of all inspiration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words Mejnour turned to lighter topics. He made the Englishman
      accompany him in long rambles through the wild scenes around, and he
      smiled approvingly when the young artist gave way to the enthusiasm which
      their fearful beauty could not have failed to rouse in a duller breast;
      and then Mejnour poured forth to his wondering pupil the stores of a
      knowledge that seemed inexhaustible and boundless. He gave accounts the
      most curious, graphic, and minute of the various races (their characters,
      habits, creeds, and manners) by which that fair land had been successively
      overrun. It is true that his descriptions could not be found in books, and
      were unsupported by learned authorities; but he possessed the true charm
      of the tale-teller, and spoke of all with the animated confidence of a
      personal witness. Sometimes, too, he would converse upon the more durable
      and the loftier mysteries of Nature with an eloquence and a research which
      invested them with all the colours rather of poetry than science.
      Insensibly the young artist found himself elevated and soothed by the lore
      of his companion; the fever of his wild desires was slaked. His mind
      became more and more lulled into the divine tranquillity of contemplation;
      he felt himself a nobler being, and in the silence of his senses he
      imagined that he heard the voice of his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to this state that Mejnour evidently sought to bring the neophyte,
      and in this elementary initiation the mystic was like every more ordinary
      sage. For he who seeks to DISCOVER must first reduce himself into a kind
      of abstract idealism, and be rendered up, in solemn and sweet bondage, to
      the faculties which CONTEMPLATE and IMAGINE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon noticed that, in their rambles, Mejnour often paused, where the
      foliage was rifest, to gather some herb or flower; and this reminded him
      that he had seen Zanoni similarly occupied. &ldquo;Can these humble children of
      Nature,&rdquo; said he one day to Mejnour,&mdash;&ldquo;things that bloom and wither
      in a day, be serviceable to the science of the higher secrets? Is there a
      pharmacy for the soul as well as the body, and do the nurslings of the
      summer minister not only to human health but spiritual immortality?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If,&rdquo; answered Mejnour, &ldquo;a stranger had visited a wandering tribe before
      one property of herbalism was known to them; if he had told the savages
      that the herbs which every day they trampled under foot were endowed with
      the most potent virtues; that one would restore to health a brother on the
      verge of death; that another would paralyse into idiocy their wisest sage;
      that a third would strike lifeless to the dust their most stalwart
      champion; that tears and laughter, vigour and disease, madness and reason,
      wakefulness and sleep, existence and dissolution, were coiled up in those
      unregarded leaves,&mdash;would they not have held him a sorcerer or a
      liar? To half the virtues of the vegetable world mankind are yet in the
      darkness of the savages I have supposed. There are faculties within us
      with which certain herbs have affinity, and over which they have power.
      The moly of the ancients is not all a fable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The apparent character of Mejnour differed in much from that of Zanoni;
      and while it fascinated Glyndon less, it subdued and impressed him more.
      The conversation of Zanoni evinced a deep and general interest for
      mankind,&mdash;a feeling approaching to enthusiasm for art and beauty. The
      stories circulated concerning his habits elevated the mystery of his life
      by actions of charity and beneficence. And in all this there was something
      genial and humane that softened the awe he created, and tended, perhaps,
      to raise suspicions as to the loftier secrets that he arrogated to
      himself. But Mejnour seemed wholly indifferent to all the actual world. If
      he committed no evil, he seemed equally apathetic to good. His deeds
      relieved no want, his words pitied no distress. What we call the heart
      appeared to have merged into the intellect. He moved, thought, and lived
      like some regular and calm abstraction, rather than one who yet retained,
      with the form, the feelings and sympathies of his kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon once, observing the tone of supreme indifference with which he
      spoke of those changes on the face of earth which he asserted he had
      witnessed, ventured to remark to him the distinction he had noted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Mejnour, coldly. &ldquo;My life is the life that
      contemplates,&mdash;Zanoni&rsquo;s is the life that enjoys: when I gather the
      herb, I think but of its uses; Zanoni will pause to admire its beauties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you deem your own the superior and the loftier existence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. His is the existence of youth,&mdash;mine of age. We have cultivated
      different faculties. Each has powers the other cannot aspire to. Those
      with whom he associates live better,&mdash;those who associate with me
      know more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard, in truth,&rdquo; said Glyndon, &ldquo;that his companions at Naples
      were observed to lead purer and nobler lives after intercourse with
      Zanoni; yet were they not strange companions, at the best, for a sage?
      This terrible power, too, that he exercises at will, as in the death of
      the Prince di &mdash;, and that of the Count Ughelli, scarcely becomes the
      tranquil seeker after good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Mejnour, with an icy smile; &ldquo;such must ever be the error of
      those philosophers who would meddle with the active life of mankind. You
      cannot serve some without injuring others; you cannot protect the good
      without warring on the bad; and if you desire to reform the faulty, why,
      you must lower yourself to live with the faulty to know their faults. Even
      so saith Paracelsus, a great man, though often wrong. [&lsquo;It is as necessary
      to know evil things as good; for who can know what is good without the
      knowing what is evil?&rsquo; etc.&mdash;Paracelsus, &lsquo;De Nat. Rer.,&rsquo; lib. 3.) Not
      mine this folly; I live but in knowledge,&mdash;I have no life in
      mankind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another time Glyndon questioned the mystic as to the nature of that union
      or fraternity to which Zanoni had once referred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am right, I suppose,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in conjecturing that you and himself
      profess to be the brothers of the Rosy Cross?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you imagine,&rdquo; answered Mejnour, &ldquo;that there were no mystic and solemn
      unions of men seeking the same end through the same means before the
      Arabians of Damus, in 1378, taught to a wandering German the secrets which
      founded the Institution of the Rosicrucians? I allow, however, that the
      Rosicrucians formed a sect descended from the greater and earlier school.
      They were wiser than the Alchemists,&mdash;their masters are wiser than
      they.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of this early and primary order how many still exist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zanoni and myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, two only!&mdash;and you profess the power to teach to all the
      secret that baffles Death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ancestor attained that secret; he died rather than survive the only
      thing he loved. We have, my pupil, no arts by which we CAN PUT DEATH OUT
      OF OUR OPTION, or out of the will of Heaven. These walls may crush me as I
      stand. All that we profess to do is but this,&mdash;to find out the
      secrets of the human frame; to know why the parts ossify and the blood
      stagnates, and to apply continual preventives to the effects of time. This
      is not magic; it is the art of medicine rightly understood. In our order
      we hold most noble,&mdash;first, that knowledge which elevates the
      intellect; secondly, that which preserves the body. But the mere art
      (extracted from the juices and simples) which recruits the animal vigour
      and arrests the progress of decay, or that more noble secret, which I will
      only hint to thee at present, by which HEAT, or CALORIC, as ye call it,
      being, as Heraclitus wisely taught, the primordial principle of life, can
      be made its perpetual renovater,&mdash;these I say, would not suffice for
      safety. It is ours also to disarm and elude the wrath of men, to turn the
      swords of our foes against each other, to glide (if not incorporeal)
      invisible to eyes over which we can throw a mist and darkness. And this
      some seers have professed to be the virtue of a stone of agate. Abaris
      placed it in his arrow. I will find you an herb in yon valley that will
      give a surer charm than the agate and the arrow. In one word, know this,
      that the humblest and meanest products of Nature are those from which the
      sublimest properties are to be drawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Glyndon, &ldquo;if possessed of these great secrets, why so churlish
      in withholding their diffusion? Does not the false or charlatanic science
      differ in this from the true and indisputable,&mdash;that the last
      communicates to the world the process by which it attains its discoveries;
      the first boasts of marvellous results, and refuses to explain the
      causes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well said, O Logician of the Schools; but think again. Suppose we were to
      impart all our knowledge to all mankind indiscriminately,&mdash;alike to
      the vicious and the virtuous,&mdash;should we be benefactors or scourges?
      Imagine the tyrant, the sensualist, the evil and corrupted being possessed
      of these tremendous powers; would he not be a demon let loose on earth?
      Grant that the same privilege be accorded also to the good; and in what
      state would be society? Engaged in a Titan war,&mdash;the good forever on
      the defensive, the bad forever in assault. In the present condition of the
      earth, evil is a more active principle than good, and the evil would
      prevail. It is for these reasons that we are not only solemnly bound to
      administer our lore only to those who will not misuse and pervert it, but
      that we place our ordeal in tests that purify the passions and elevate the
      desires. And Nature in this controls and assists us: for it places awful
      guardians and insurmountable barriers between the ambition of vice and the
      heaven of the loftier science.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such made a small part of the numerous conversations Mejnour held with his
      pupil,&mdash;conversations that, while they appeared to address themselves
      to the reason, inflamed yet more the fancy. It was the very disclaiming of
      all powers which Nature, properly investigated, did not suffice to create,
      that gave an air of probability to those which Mejnour asserted Nature
      might bestow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus days and weeks rolled on; and the mind of Glyndon, gradually fitted
      to this sequestered and musing life, forgot at last the vanities and
      chimeras of the world without.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening he had lingered alone and late upon the ramparts, watching the
      stars as, one by one, they broke upon the twilight. Never had he felt so
      sensibly the mighty power of the heavens and the earth upon man; how much
      the springs of our intellectual being are moved and acted upon by the
      solemn influences of Nature. As a patient on whom, slowly and by degrees,
      the agencies of mesmerism are brought to bear, he acknowledged to his
      heart the growing force of that vast and universal magnetism which is the
      life of creation, and binds the atom to the whole. A strange and ineffable
      consciousness of power, of the SOMETHING GREAT within the perishable clay,
      appealed to feelings at once dim and glorious,&mdash;like the faint
      recognitions of a holier and former being. An impulse, that he could not
      resist, led him to seek the mystic. He would demand, that hour, his
      initiation into the worlds beyond our world,&mdash;he was prepared to
      breathe a diviner air. He entered the castle, and strode the shadowy and
      starlit gallery which conducted to Mejnour&rsquo;s apartment.

      CHAPTER 4.III.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Man is the eye of things.&mdash;Euryph, &ldquo;de Vit. Hum.&rdquo;
 
     ...There is, therefore, a certain ecstatical or transporting
     power, which, if at any time it shall be excited or stirred up by
     an ardent desire and most strong imagination, is able to conduct
     the spirit of the more outward even to some absent and
     far-distant object.&mdash;Von Helmont.
</pre>
    <p>
      The rooms that Mejnour occupied consisted of two chambers communicating
      with each other, and a third in which he slept. All these rooms were
      placed in the huge square tower that beetled over the dark and bush-grown
      precipice. The first chamber which Glyndon entered was empty. With a
      noiseless step he passed on, and opened the door that admitted into the
      inner one. He drew back at the threshold, overpowered by a strong
      fragrance which filled the chamber: a kind of mist thickened the air
      rather than obscured it, for this vapour was not dark, but resembled a
      snow-cloud moving slowly, and in heavy undulations, wave upon wave
      regularly over the space. A mortal cold struck to the Englishman&rsquo;s heart,
      and his blood froze. He stood rooted to the spot; and as his eyes strained
      involuntarily through the vapour, he fancied (for he could not be sure
      that it was not the trick of his imagination) that he saw dim,
      spectre-like, but gigantic forms floating through the mist; or was it not
      rather the mist itself that formed its vapours fantastically into those
      moving, impalpable, and bodiless apparitions? A great painter of antiquity
      is said, in a picture of Hades, to have represented the monsters that
      glide through the ghostly River of the Dead, so artfully, that the eye
      perceived at once that the river itself was but a spectre, and the
      bloodless things that tenanted it had no life, their forms blending with
      the dead waters till, as the eye continued to gaze, it ceased to discern
      them from the preternatural element they were supposed to inhabit. Such
      were the moving outlines that coiled and floated through the mist; but
      before Glyndon had even drawn breath in this atmosphere&mdash;for his life
      itself seemed arrested or changed into a kind of horrid trance&mdash;he
      felt his hand seized, and he was led from that room into the outer one. He
      heard the door close,&mdash;his blood rushed again through his veins, and
      he saw Mejnour by his side. Strong convulsions then suddenly seized his
      whole frame,&mdash;he fell to the ground insensible. When he recovered, he
      found himself in the open air in a rude balcony of stone that jutted from
      the chamber, the stars shining serenely over the dark abyss below, and
      resting calmly upon the face of the mystic, who stood beside him with
      folded arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said Mejnour, &ldquo;judge by what you have just felt, how
      dangerous it is to seek knowledge until prepared to receive it. Another
      moment in the air of that chamber and you had been a corpse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then of what nature was the knowledge that you, once mortal like myself,
      could safely have sought in that icy atmosphere, which it was death for me
      to breathe? Mejnour,&rdquo; continued Glyndon, and his wild desire, sharpened by
      the very danger he had passed, once more animated and nerved him, &ldquo;I am
      prepared at least for the first steps. I come to you as of old the pupil
      to the Hierophant, and demand the initiation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mejnour passed his hand over the young man&rsquo;s heart,&mdash;it beat loud,
      regularly, and boldly. He looked at him with something almost like
      admiration in his passionless and frigid features, and muttered, half to
      himself, &ldquo;Surely, in so much courage the true disciple is found at last.&rdquo;
       Then, speaking aloud, he added, &ldquo;Be it so; man&rsquo;s first initiation is in
      TRANCE. In dreams commences all human knowledge; in dreams hovers over
      measureless space the first faint bridge between spirit and spirit,&mdash;this
      world and the worlds beyond! Look steadfastly on yonder star!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon obeyed, and Mejnour retired into the chamber, from which there
      then slowly emerged a vapour, somewhat paler and of fainter odour than
      that which had nearly produced so fatal an effect on his frame. This, on
      the contrary, as it coiled around him, and then melted in thin spires into
      the air, breathed a refreshing and healthful fragrance. He still kept his
      eyes on the star, and the star seemed gradually to fix and command his
      gaze. A sort of languor next seized his frame, but without, as he thought,
      communicating itself to the mind; and as this crept over him, he felt his
      temples sprinkled with some volatile and fiery essence. At the same moment
      a slight tremor shook his limbs and thrilled through his veins. The
      languor increased, still he kept his gaze upon the star, and now its
      luminous circumference seemed to expand and dilate. It became gradually
      softer and clearer in its light; spreading wider and broader, it diffused
      all space,&mdash;all space seemed swallowed up in it. And at last, in the
      midst of a silver shining atmosphere, he felt as if something burst within
      his brain,&mdash;as if a strong chain were broken; and at that moment a
      sense of heavenly liberty, of unutterable delight, of freedom from the
      body, of birdlike lightness, seemed to float him into the space itself.
      &ldquo;Whom, now upon earth, dost thou wish to see?&rdquo; whispered the voice of
      Mejnour. &ldquo;Viola and Zanoni!&rdquo; answered Glyndon, in his heart; but he felt
      that his lips moved not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly at that thought,&mdash;through this space, in which nothing save
      one mellow translucent light had been discernible,&mdash;a swift
      succession of shadowy landscapes seemed to roll: trees, mountains, cities,
      seas, glided along like the changes of a phantasmagoria; and at last,
      settled and stationary, he saw a cave by the gradual marge of an ocean
      shore,&mdash;myrtles and orange-trees clothing the gentle banks. On a
      height, at a distance, gleamed the white but shattered relics of some
      ruined heathen edifice; and the moon, in calm splendour, shining over all,
      literally bathed with its light two forms without the cave, at whose feet
      the blue waters crept, and he thought that he even heard them murmur. He
      recognised both the figures. Zanoni was seated on a fragment of stone;
      Viola, half-reclining by his side, was looking into his face, which was
      bent down to her, and in her countenance was the expression of that
      perfect happiness which belongs to perfect love. &ldquo;Wouldst thou hear them
      speak?&rdquo; whispered Mejnour; and again, without sound, Glyndon inly
      answered, &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Their voices then came to his ear, but in tones that
      seemed to him strange; so subdued were they, and sounding, as it were, so
      far off, that they were as voices heard in the visions of some holier men
      from a distant sphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is it,&rdquo; said Viola, &ldquo;that thou canst find pleasure in listening
      to the ignorant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the heart is never ignorant; because the mysteries of the
      feelings are as full of wonder as those of the intellect. If at times thou
      canst not comprehend the language of my thoughts, at times also I hear
      sweet enigmas in that of thy emotions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, say not so!&rdquo; said Viola, winding her arm tenderly round his neck, and
      under that heavenly light her face seemed lovelier for its blushes. &ldquo;For
      the enigmas are but love&rsquo;s common language, and love should solve them.
      Till I knew thee,&mdash;till I lived with thee; till I learned to watch
      for thy footstep when absent: yet even in absence to see thee everywhere!&mdash;I
      dreamed not how strong and all-pervading is the connection between nature
      and the human soul!...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I am now assured of what I at first believed,&mdash;that
      the feelings which attracted me towards thee at first were not those of
      love. I know THAT, by comparing the present with the past,&mdash;it was a
      sentiment then wholly of the mind or the spirit! I could not hear thee now
      say, &lsquo;Viola, be happy with another!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I could not now tell thee so! Ah, Viola, never be weary of assuring
      me that thou art happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy while thou art so. Yet at times, Zanoni, thou art so sad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because human life is so short; because we must part at last; because yon
      moon shines on when the nightingale sings to it no more! A little while,
      and thine eyes will grow dim, and thy beauty haggard, and these locks that
      I toy with now will be grey and loveless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thou, cruel one!&rdquo; said Viola, touchingly, &ldquo;I shall never see the
      signs of age in thee! But shall we not grow old together, and our eyes be
      accustomed to a change which the heart shall not share!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanoni sighed. He turned away, and seemed to commune with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon&rsquo;s attention grew yet more earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But were it so,&rdquo; muttered Zanoni; and then looking steadfastly at Viola,
      he said, with a half-smile, &ldquo;Hast thou no curiosity to learn more of the
      lover thou once couldst believe the agent of the Evil One?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None; all that one wishes to know of the beloved one, I know&mdash;THAT
      THOU LOVEST ME!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told thee that my life is apart from others. Wouldst thou not seek
      to share it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I share it now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But were it possible to be thus young and fair forever, till the world
      blazes round us as one funeral pyre!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be so, when we leave the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanoni was mute for some moments, and at length he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Canst thou recall those brilliant and aerial dreams which once visited
      thee, when thou didst fancy that thou wert preordained to some fate aloof
      and afar from the common children of the earth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zanoni, the fate is found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And hast thou no terror of the future?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The future! I forget it! Time past and present and to come reposes in thy
      smile. Ah, Zanoni, play not with the foolish credulities of my youth! I
      have been better and humbler since thy presence has dispelled the mist of
      the air. The future!&mdash;well, when I have cause to dread it, I will
      look up to heaven, and remember who guides our fate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she lifted her eyes above, a dark cloud swept suddenly over the scene.
      It wrapped the orange-trees, the azure ocean, the dense sands; but still
      the last images that it veiled from the charmed eyes of Glyndon were the
      forms of Viola and Zanoni. The face of the one rapt, serene, and radiant;
      the face of the other, dark, thoughtful, and locked in more than its usual
      rigidness of melancholy beauty and profound repose.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Rouse thyself,&rdquo; said Mejnour; &ldquo;thy ordeal has commenced! There are
      pretenders to the solemn science who could have shown thee the absent, and
      prated to thee, in their charlatanic jargon, of the secret electricities
      and the magnetic fluid of whose true properties they know but the germs
      and elements. I will lend thee the books of those glorious dupes, and thou
      wilt find, in the dark ages, how many erring steps have stumbled upon the
      threshold of the mighty learning, and fancied they had pierced the temple.
      Hermes and Albert and Paracelsus, I knew ye all; but, noble as ye were, ye
      were fated to be deceived. Ye had not souls of faith, and daring fitted
      for the destinies at which ye aimed! Yet Paracelsus&mdash;modest
      Paracelsus&mdash;had an arrogance that soared higher than all our
      knowledge. Ho, ho!&mdash;he thought he could make a race of men from
      chemistry; he arrogated to himself the Divine gift,&mdash;the breath of
      life. (Paracelsus, &lsquo;De Nat. Rer.,&rsquo; lib. i.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would have made men, and, after all, confessed that they could be but
      pygmies! My art is to make men above mankind. But you are impatient of my
      digressions. Forgive me. All these men (they were great dreamers, as you
      desire to be) were intimate friends of mine. But they are dead and rotten.
      They talked of spirits,&mdash;but they dreaded to be in other company than
      that of men. Like orators whom I have heard, when I stood by the Pnyx of
      Athens, blazing with words like comets in the assembly, and extinguishing
      their ardour like holiday rockets when they were in the field. Ho, ho!
      Demosthenes, my hero-coward, how nimble were thy heels at Chaeronea! And
      thou art impatient still! Boy, I could tell thee such truths of the past
      as would make thee the luminary of schools. But thou lustest only for the
      shadows of the future. Thou shalt have thy wish. But the mind must be
      first exercised and trained. Go to thy room, and sleep; fast austerely,
      read no books; meditate, imagine, dream, bewilder thyself if thou wilt.
      Thought shapes out its own chaos at last. Before midnight, seek me again!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 4.IV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     It is fit that we who endeavour to rise to an elevation so
     sublime, should study first to leave behind carnal affections,
     the frailty of the senses, the passions that belong to matter;
     secondly, to learn by what means we may ascend to the climax of
     pure intellect, united with the powers above, without which never
     can we gain the lore of secret things, nor the magic that effects
     true wonders.&mdash;Tritemius &ldquo;On Secret Things and Secret Spirits.&rdquo;
  </pre>
    <p>
      It wanted still many minutes of midnight, and Glyndon was once more in the
      apartment of the mystic. He had rigidly observed the fast ordained to him;
      and in the rapt and intense reveries into which his excited fancy had
      plunged him, he was not only insensible to the wants of the flesh,&mdash;he
      felt above them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mejnour, seated beside his disciple, thus addressed him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man is arrogant in proportion to his ignorance. Man&rsquo;s natural tendency is
      to egotism. Man, in his infancy of knowledge, thinks that all creation was
      formed for him. For several ages he saw in the countless worlds that
      sparkle through space like the bubbles of a shoreless ocean only the petty
      candles, the household torches, that Providence had been pleased to light
      for no other purpose but to make the night more agreeable to man.
      Astronomy has corrected this delusion of human vanity; and man now
      reluctantly confesses that the stars are worlds larger and more glorious
      than his own,&mdash;that the earth on which he crawls is a scarce visible
      speck on the vast chart of creation. But in the small as in the vast, God
      is equally profuse of life. The traveller looks upon the tree, and fancies
      its boughs were formed for his shelter in the summer sun, or his fuel in
      the winter frosts. But in each leaf of these boughs the Creator has made a
      world; it swarms with innumerable races. Each drop of the water in yon
      moat is an orb more populous than a kingdom is of men. Everywhere, then,
      in this immense design, science brings new life to light. Life is the one
      pervading principle, and even the thing that seems to die and putrify but
      engenders new life, and changes to fresh forms of matter. Reasoning, then,
      by evident analogy: if not a leaf, if not a drop of water, but is, no less
      than yonder star, a habitable and breathing world,&mdash;nay, if even man
      himself is a world to other lives, and millions and myriads dwell in the
      rivers of his blood, and inhabit man&rsquo;s frame as man inhabits earth,
      commonsense (if your schoolmen had it) would suffice to teach that the
      circumfluent infinite which you call space&mdash;the countless Impalpable
      which divides earth from the moon and stars&mdash;is filled also with its
      correspondent and appropriate life. Is it not a visible absurdity to
      suppose that being is crowded upon every leaf, and yet absent from the
      immensities of space? The law of the Great System forbids the waste even
      of an atom; it knows no spot where something of life does not breathe. In
      the very charnel-house is the nursery of production and animation. Is that
      true? Well, then, can you conceive that space, which is the Infinite
      itself, is alone a waste, is alone lifeless, is less useful to the one
      design of universal being than the dead carcass of a dog, than the peopled
      leaf, than the swarming globule? The microscope shows you the creatures on
      the leaf; no mechanical tube is yet invented to discover the nobler and
      more gifted things that hover in the illimitable air. Yet between these
      last and man is a mysterious and terrible affinity. And hence, by tales
      and legends, not wholly false nor wholly true, have arisen from time to
      time, beliefs in apparitions and spectres. If more common to the earlier
      and simpler tribes than to the men of your duller age, it is but that,
      with the first, the senses are more keen and quick. And as the savage can
      see or scent miles away the traces of a foe, invisible to the gross sense
      of the civilised animal, so the barrier itself between him and the
      creatures of the airy world is less thickened and obscured. Do you
      listen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With my soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But first, to penetrate this barrier, the soul with which you listen must
      be sharpened by intense enthusiasm, purified from all earthlier desires.
      Not without reason have the so-styled magicians, in all lands and times,
      insisted on chastity and abstemious reverie as the communicants of
      inspiration. When thus prepared, science can be brought to aid it; the
      sight itself may be rendered more subtle, the nerves more acute, the
      spirit more alive and outward, and the element itself&mdash;the air, the
      space&mdash;may be made, by certain secrets of the higher chemistry, more
      palpable and clear. And this, too, is not magic, as the credulous call it;
      as I have so often said before, magic (or science that violates Nature)
      exists not: it is but the science by which Nature can be controlled. Now,
      in space there are millions of beings not literally spiritual, for they
      have all, like the animalculae unseen by the naked eye, certain forms of
      matter, though matter so delicate, air-drawn, and subtle, that it is, as
      it were, but a film, a gossamer that clothes the spirit. Hence the
      Rosicrucian&rsquo;s lovely phantoms of sylph and gnome. Yet, in truth, these
      races and tribes differ more widely, each from each, than the Calmuc from
      the Greek,&mdash;differ in attributes and powers. In the drop of water you
      see how the animalculae vary, how vast and terrible are some of those
      monster mites as compared with others. Equally so with the inhabitants of
      the atmosphere: some of surpassing wisdom, some of horrible malignity;
      some hostile as fiends to men, others gentle as messengers between earth
      and heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He who would establish intercourse with these varying beings resembles
      the traveller who would penetrate into unknown lands. He is exposed to
      strange dangers and unconjectured terrors. THAT INTERCOURSE ONCE GAINED, I
      CANNOT SECURE THEE FROM THE CHANCES TO WHICH THY JOURNEY IS EXPOSED. I
      cannot direct thee to paths free from the wanderings of the deadliest
      foes. Thou must alone, and of thyself, face and hazard all. But if thou
      art so enamoured of life as to care only to live on, no matter for what
      ends, recruiting the nerves and veins with the alchemist&rsquo;s vivifying
      elixir, why seek these dangers from the intermediate tribes? Because the
      very elixir that pours a more glorious life into the frame, so sharpens
      the senses that those larvae of the air become to thee audible and
      apparent; so that, unless trained by degrees to endure the phantoms and
      subdue their malice, a life thus gifted would be the most awful doom man
      could bring upon himself. Hence it is, that though the elixir be
      compounded of the simplest herbs, his frame only is prepared to receive it
      who has gone through the subtlest trials. Nay, some, scared and daunted
      into the most intolerable horror by the sights that burst upon their eyes
      at the first draft, have found the potion less powerful to save than the
      agony and travail of Nature to destroy. To the unprepared the elixir is
      thus but the deadliest poison. Amidst the dwellers of the threshold is
      ONE, too, surpassing in malignity and hatred all her tribe,&mdash;one
      whose eyes have paralyzed the bravest, and whose power increases over the
      spirit precisely in proportion to its fear. Does thy courage falter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay; thy words but kindle it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me, then, and submit to the initiatory labours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that, Mejnour led him into the interior chamber, and proceeded to
      explain to him certain chemical operations which, though extremely simple
      in themselves, Glyndon soon perceived were capable of very extraordinary
      results.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the remoter times,&rdquo; said Mejnour, smiling, &ldquo;our brotherhood were often
      compelled to recur to delusions to protect realities; and, as dexterous
      mechanicians or expert chemists, they obtained the name of sorcerers.
      Observe how easy to construct is the Spectre Lion that attended the
      renowned Leonardo da Vinci!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Glyndon beheld with delighted surprise the simple means by which the
      wildest cheats of the imagination can be formed. The magical landscapes in
      which Baptista Porta rejoiced; the apparent change of the seasons with
      which Albertus Magnus startled the Earl of Holland; nay, even those more
      dread delusions of the Ghost and Image with which the necromancers of
      Heraclea woke the conscience of the conqueror of Plataea (Pausanias,&mdash;see
      Plutarch.),&mdash;all these, as the showman enchants some trembling
      children on a Christmas Eve with his lantern and phantasmagoria, Mejnour
      exhibited to his pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now laugh forever at magic! when these, the very tricks, the very
      sports and frivolities of science, were the very acts which men viewed
      with abhorrence, and inquisitors and kings rewarded with the rack and the
      stake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the alchemist&rsquo;s transmutation of metals&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nature herself is a laboratory in which metals, and all elements, are
      forever at change. Easy to make gold,&mdash;easier, more commodious, and
      cheaper still, to make the pearl, the diamond, and the ruby. Oh, yes; wise
      men found sorcery in this too; but they found no sorcery in the discovery
      that by the simplest combination of things of every-day use they could
      raise a devil that would sweep away thousands of their kind by the breath
      of consuming fire. Discover what will destroy life, and you are a great
      man!&mdash;what will prolong it, and you are an imposter! Discover some
      invention in machinery that will make the rich more rich and the poor more
      poor, and they will build you a statue! Discover some mystery in art that
      will equalise physical disparities, and they will pull down their own
      houses to stone you! Ha, ha, my pupil! such is the world Zanoni still
      cares for!&mdash;you and I will leave this world to itself. And now that
      you have seen some few of the effects of science, begin to learn its
      grammar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mejnour then set before his pupil certain tasks, in which the rest of the
      night wore itself away.

      CHAPTER 4.V.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Great travell hath the gentle Calidore
     And toyle endured...
     There on a day,&mdash;He chaunst to spy a sort of shepheard groomes,
     Playing on pipes and caroling apace.
     ...He, there besyde
     Saw a faire damzell.
     &mdash;Spenser, &ldquo;Faerie Queene,&rdquo; cant. ix.
</pre>
    <p>
      For a considerable period the pupil of Mejnour was now absorbed in labour
      dependent on the most vigilant attention, on the most minute and subtle
      calculation. Results astonishing and various rewarded his toils and
      stimulated his interest. Nor were these studies limited to chemical
      discovery,&mdash;in which it is permitted me to say that the greatest
      marvels upon the organisation of physical life seemed wrought by
      experiments of the vivifying influence of heat. Mejnour professed to find
      a link between all intellectual beings in the existence of a certain
      all-pervading and invisible fluid resembling electricity, yet distinct
      from the known operations of that mysterious agency&mdash;a fluid that
      connected thought to thought with the rapidity and precision of the modern
      telegraph, and the influence of this fluid, according to Mejnour, extended
      to the remotest past,&mdash;that is to say, whenever and wheresoever man
      had thought. Thus, if the doctrine were true, all human knowledge became
      attainable through a medium established between the brain of the
      individual inquirer and all the farthest and obscurest regions in the
      universe of ideas. Glyndon was surprised to find Mejnour attached to the
      abstruse mysteries which the Pythagoreans ascribed to the occult science
      of NUMBERS. In this last, new lights glimmered dimly on his eyes; and he
      began to perceive that even the power to predict, or rather to calculate,
      results, might by&mdash; (Here there is an erasure in the MS.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      But he observed that the last brief process by which, in each of these
      experiments, the wonder was achieved, Mejnour reserved for himself, and
      refused to communicate the secret. The answer he obtained to his
      remonstrances on this head was more stern than satisfactory:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dost thou think,&rdquo; said Mejnour, &ldquo;that I would give to the mere pupil,
      whose qualities are not yet tried, powers that might change the face of
      the social world? The last secrets are intrusted only to him of whose
      virtue the Master is convinced. Patience! It is labour itself that is the
      great purifier of the mind; and by degrees the secrets will grow upon
      thyself as thy mind becomes riper to receive them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last Mejnour professed himself satisfied with the progress made by his
      pupil. &ldquo;The hour now arrives,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when thou mayst pass the great
      but airy barrier,&mdash;when thou mayst gradually confront the terrible
      Dweller of the Threshold. Continue thy labours&mdash;continue to surpass
      thine impatience for results until thou canst fathom the causes. I leave
      thee for one month; if at the end of that period, when I return, the tasks
      set thee are completed, and thy mind prepared by contemplation and austere
      thought for the ordeal, I promise thee the ordeal shall commence. One
      caution alone I give thee: regard it as a peremptory command, enter not
      this chamber!&rdquo; (They were then standing in the room where their
      experiments had been chiefly made, and in which Glyndon, on the night he
      had sought the solitude of the mystic, had nearly fallen a victim to his
      intrusion.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enter not this chamber till my return; or, above all, if by any search
      for materials necessary to thy toils thou shouldst venture hither, forbear
      to light the naphtha in those vessels, and to open the vases on yonder
      shelves. I leave the key of the room in thy keeping, in order to try thy
      abstinence and self-control. Young man, this very temptation is a part of
      thy trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that, Mejnour placed the key in his hands; and at sunset he left the
      castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several days Glyndon continued immersed in employments which strained
      to the utmost all the faculties of his intellect. Even the most partial
      success depended so entirely on the abstraction of the mind, and the
      minuteness of its calculations, that there was scarcely room for any other
      thought than those absorbed in the occupation. And doubtless this
      perpetual strain of the faculties was the object of Mejnour in works that
      did not seem exactly pertinent to the purposes in view. As the study of
      the elementary mathematics, for example, is not so profitable in the
      solving of problems, useless in our after-callings, as it is serviceable
      in training the intellect to the comprehension and analysis of general
      truths.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in less than half the time which Mejnour had stated for the duration
      of his absence, all that the mystic had appointed to his toils was
      completed by the pupil; and then his mind, thus relieved from the drudgery
      and mechanism of employment, once more sought occupation in dim conjecture
      and restless fancies. His inquisitive and rash nature grew excited by the
      prohibition of Mejnour, and he found himself gazing too often, with
      perturbed and daring curiosity, upon the key of the forbidden chamber. He
      began to feel indignant at a trial of constancy which he deemed frivolous
      and puerile. What nursery tales of Bluebeard and his closet were revived
      to daunt and terrify him! How could the mere walls of a chamber, in which
      he had so often securely pursued his labours, start into living danger? If
      haunted, it could be but by those delusions which Mejnour had taught him
      to despise,&mdash;a shadowy lion,&mdash;a chemical phantasm! Tush! he lost
      half his awe of Mejnour, when he thought that by such tricks the sage
      could practise upon the very intellect he had awakened and instructed!
      Still he resisted the impulses of his curiosity and his pride, and, to
      escape from their dictation, he took long rambles on the hills, or amidst
      the valleys that surrounded the castle,&mdash;seeking by bodily fatigue to
      subdue the unreposing mind. One day suddenly emerging from a dark ravine,
      he came upon one of those Italian scenes of rural festivity and mirth in
      which the classic age appears to revive. It was a festival, partly
      agricultural, partly religious, held yearly by the peasants of that
      district. Assembled at the outskirts of a village, animated crowds, just
      returned from a procession to a neighbouring chapel, were now forming
      themselves into groups: the old to taste the vintage, the young to dance,&mdash;all
      to be gay and happy. This sudden picture of easy joy and careless
      ignorance, contrasting so forcibly with the intense studies and that
      parching desire for wisdom which had so long made up his own life, and
      burned at his own heart, sensibly affected Glyndon. As he stood aloof and
      gazing on them, the young man felt once more that he was young. The memory
      of all he had been content to sacrifice spoke to him like the sharp voice
      of remorse. The flitting forms of the women in their picturesque attire,
      their happy laughter ringing through the cool, still air of the autumn
      noon, brought back to the heart, or rather perhaps to the senses, the
      images of his past time, the &ldquo;golden shepherd hours,&rdquo; when to live was but
      to enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He approached nearer and nearer to the scene, and suddenly a noisy group
      swept round him; and Maestro Paolo, tapping him familiarly on the
      shoulder, exclaimed in a hearty voice, &ldquo;Welcome, Excellency!&mdash;we are
      rejoiced to see you amongst us.&rdquo; Glyndon was about to reply to this
      salutation, when his eyes rested upon the face of a young girl leaning on
      Paolo&rsquo;s arm, of a beauty so attractive that his colour rose and his heart
      beat as he encountered her gaze. Her eyes sparkled with a roguish and
      petulant mirth, her parted lips showed teeth like pearls; as if impatient
      at the pause of her companion from the revel of the rest, her little foot
      beat the ground to a measure that she half-hummed, half-chanted. Paolo
      laughed as he saw the effect the girl had produced upon the young
      foreigner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not dance, Excellency? Come, lay aside your greatness, and be
      merry, like us poor devils. See how our pretty Fillide is longing for a
      partner. Take compassion on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fillide pouted at this speech, and, disengaging her arm from Paolo&rsquo;s,
      turned away, but threw over her shoulder a glance half inviting, half
      defying. Glyndon, almost involuntarily, advanced to her, and addressed
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, yes; he addresses her! She looks down, and smiles. Paolo leaves them
      to themselves, sauntering off with a devil-me-carish air. Fillide speaks
      now, and looks up at the scholar&rsquo;s face with arch invitation. He shakes
      his head; Fillide laughs, and her laugh is silvery. She points to a gay
      mountaineer, who is tripping up to her merrily. Why does Glyndon feel
      jealous? Why, when she speaks again, does he shake his head no more? He
      offers his hand; Fillide blushes, and takes it with a demure coquetry.
      What! is it so, indeed! They whirl into the noisy circle of the revellers.
      Ha! ha! is not this better than distilling herbs, and breaking thy brains
      on Pythagorean numbers? How lightly Fillide bounds along! How her
      lithesome waist supples itself to thy circling arm! Tara-ra-tara, ta-tara,
      rara-ra! What the devil is in the measure that it makes the blood course
      like quicksilver through the veins? Was there ever a pair of eyes like
      Fillide&rsquo;s? Nothing of the cold stars there! Yet how they twinkle and laugh
      at thee! And that rosy, pursed-up mouth that will answer so sparingly to
      thy flatteries, as if words were a waste of time, and kisses were their
      proper language. Oh, pupil of Mejnour! Oh, would-be Rosicrucian,
      Platonist, Magian, I know not what! I am ashamed of thee! What, in the
      names of Averroes and Burri and Agrippa and Hermes have become of thy
      austere contemplations? Was it for this thou didst resign Viola? I don&rsquo;t
      think thou hast the smallest recollection of the elixir or the Cabala.
      Take care! What are you about, sir? Why do you clasp that small hand
      locked within your own? Why do you&mdash;Tara-rara tara-ra tara-rara-ra,
      rarara, ta-ra, a-ra! Keep your eyes off those slender ankles and that
      crimson bodice! Tara-rara-ra! There they go again! And now they rest under
      the broad trees. The revel has whirled away from them. They hear&mdash;or
      do they not hear&mdash;the laughter at the distance? They see&mdash;or if
      they have their eyes about them, they SHOULD see&mdash;couple after couple
      gliding by, love-talking and love-looking. But I will lay a wager, as they
      sit under that tree, and the round sun goes down behind the mountains,
      that they see or hear very little except themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hollo, Signor Excellency! and how does your partner please you? Come and
      join our feast, loiterers; one dances more merrily after wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down goes the round sun; up comes the autumn moon. Tara, tara, rarara,
      rarara, tarara-ra! Dancing again; is it a dance, or some movement gayer,
      noisier, wilder still? How they glance and gleam through the night
      shadows, those flitting forms! What confusion!&mdash;what order! Ha, that
      is the Tarantula dance; Maestro Paolo foots it bravely! Diavolo, what
      fury! the Tarantula has stung them all. Dance or die; it is fury,&mdash;the
      Corybantes, the Maenads, the&mdash;Ho, ho! more wine! the Sabbat of the
      Witches at Benevento is a joke to this! From cloud to cloud wanders the
      moon,&mdash;now shining, now lost. Dimness while the maiden blushes; light
      when the maiden smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fillide, thou art an enchantress!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buona notte, Excellency; you will see me again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, young man,&rdquo; said an old, decrepit, hollow-eyed octogenarian, leaning
      on his staff, &ldquo;make the best of your youth. I, too, once had a Fillide! I
      was handsomer than you then! Alas! if we could be always young!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always young!&rdquo; Glyndon started, as he turned his gaze from the fresh,
      fair, rosy face of the girl, and saw the eyes dropping rheum, the yellow
      wrinkled skin, the tottering frame of the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; said the decrepit creature, hobbling near to him, and with a
      malicious laugh. &ldquo;Yet I, too, was young once! Give me a baioccho for a
      glass of aqua vitae!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tara, rara, ra-rara, tara, rara-ra! There dances Youth! Wrap thy rags
      round thee, and totter off, Old Age!

      CHAPTER 4.VI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Whilest Calidore does follow that faire mayd,
     Unmindful of his vow and high beheast
     Which by the Faerie Queene was on him layd.
     &mdash;Spenser, &ldquo;Faerie Queene,&rdquo; cant. x. s. 1.
</pre>
    <p>
      It was that grey, indistinct, struggling interval between the night and
      the dawn, when Clarence stood once more in his chamber. The abstruse
      calculations lying on his table caught his eye, and filled him with a
      sentiment of weariness and distaste. But&mdash;&ldquo;Alas, if we could be
      always young! Oh, thou horrid spectre of the old, rheum-eyed man! What
      apparition can the mystic chamber shadow forth more ugly and more hateful
      than thou? Oh, yes, if we could be always young! But not [thinks the
      neophyte now]&mdash;not to labour forever at these crabbed figures and
      these cold compounds of herbs and drugs. No; but to enjoy, to love, to
      revel! What should be the companion of youth but pleasure? And the gift of
      eternal youth may be mine this very hour! What means this prohibition of
      Mejnour&rsquo;s? Is it not of the same complexion as his ungenerous reserve even
      in the minutest secrets of chemistry, or the numbers of his Cabala?&mdash;compelling
      me to perform all the toils, and yet withholding from me the knowledge of
      the crowning result? No doubt he will still, on his return, show me that
      the great mystery CAN be attained; but will still forbid ME to attain it.
      Is it not as if he desired to keep my youth the slave to his age; to make
      me dependent solely on himself; to bind me to a journeyman&rsquo;s service by
      perpetual excitement to curiosity, and the sight of the fruits he places
      beyond my lips?&rdquo; These, and many reflections still more repining,
      disturbed and irritated him. Heated with wine&mdash;excited by the wild
      revels he had left&mdash;he was unable to sleep. The image of that
      revolting Old Age which Time, unless defeated, must bring upon himself,
      quickened the eagerness of his desire for the dazzling and imperishable
      Youth he ascribed to Zanoni. The prohibition only served to create a
      spirit of defiance. The reviving day, laughing jocundly through his
      lattice, dispelled all the fears and superstitions that belong to night.
      The mystic chamber presented to his imagination nothing to differ from any
      other apartment in the castle. What foul or malignant apparition could
      harm him in the light of that blessed sun! It was the peculiar, and on the
      whole most unhappy, contradiction in Glyndon&rsquo;s nature, that while his
      reasonings led him to doubt,&mdash;and doubt rendered him in MORAL conduct
      irresolute and unsteady; he was PHYSICALLY brave to rashness. Nor is this
      uncommon: scepticism and presumption are often twins. When a man of this
      character determines upon any action, personal fear never deters him; and
      for the moral fear, any sophistry suffices to self-will. Almost without
      analysing himself the mental process by which his nerves hardened
      themselves and his limbs moved, he traversed the corridor, gained
      Mejnour&rsquo;s apartment, and opened the forbidden door. All was as he had been
      accustomed to see it, save that on a table in the centre of the room lay
      open a large volume. He approached, and gazed on the characters on the
      page; they were in a cipher, the study of which had made a part of his
      labours. With but slight difficulty he imagined that he interpreted the
      meaning of the first sentences, and that they ran thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To quaff the inner life, is to see the outer life: to live in defiance of
      time, is to live in the whole. He who discovers the elixir discovers what
      lies in space; for the spirit that vivifies the frame strengthens the
      senses. There is attraction in the elementary principle of light. In the
      lamps of Rosicrucius the fire is the pure elementary principle. Kindle the
      lamps while thou openst the vessel that contains the elixir, and the light
      attracts towards thee those beings whose life is that light. Beware of
      Fear. Fear is the deadliest enemy to Knowledge.&rdquo; Here the ciphers changed
      their character, and became incomprehensible. But had he not read enough?
      Did not the last sentence suffice?&mdash;&ldquo;Beware of Fear!&rdquo; It was as if
      Mejnour had purposely left the page open,&mdash;as if the trial was, in
      truth, the reverse of the one pretended; as if the mystic had designed to
      make experiment of his COURAGE while affecting but that of his
      FORBEARANCE. Not Boldness, but Fear, was the deadliest enemy to Knowledge.
      He moved to the shelves on which the crystal vases were placed; with an
      untrembling hand he took from one of them the stopper, and a delicious
      odor suddenly diffused itself through the room. The air sparkled as if
      with a diamond-dust. A sense of unearthly delight,&mdash;of an existence
      that seemed all spirit, flashed through his whole frame; and a faint, low,
      but exquisite music crept, thrilling, through the chamber. At this moment
      he heard a voice in the corridor calling on his name; and presently there
      was a knock at the door without. &ldquo;Are you there, signor?&rdquo; said the clear
      tones of Maestro Paolo. Glyndon hastily reclosed and replaced the vial,
      and bidding Paolo await him in his own apartment, tarried till he heard
      the intruder&rsquo;s steps depart; he then reluctantly quitted the room. As he
      locked the door, he still heard the dying strain of that fairy music; and
      with a light step and a joyous heart he repaired to Paolo, inly resolving
      to visit again the chamber at an hour when his experiment would be safe
      from interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he crossed his threshold, Paolo started back, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Why,
      Excellency! I scarcely recognise you! Amusement, I see, is a great
      beautifier to the young. Yesterday you looked so pale and haggard; but
      Fillide&rsquo;s merry eyes have done more for you than the Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone
      (saints forgive me for naming it) ever did for the wizards.&rdquo; And Glyndon,
      glancing at the old Venetian mirror as Paolo spoke, was scarcely less
      startled than Paolo himself at the change in his own mien and bearing. His
      form, before bent with thought, seemed to him taller by half the head, so
      lithesome and erect rose his slender stature; his eyes glowed, his cheeks
      bloomed with health and the innate and pervading pleasure. If the mere
      fragrance of the elixir was thus potent, well might the alchemists have
      ascribed life and youth to the draught!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must forgive me, Excellency, for disturbing you,&rdquo; said Paolo,
      producing a letter from his pouch; &ldquo;but our Patron has just written to me
      to say that he will be here to-morrow, and desired me to lose not a moment
      in giving to yourself this billet, which he enclosed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who brought the letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A horseman, who did not wait for any reply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon opened the letter, and read as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I return a week sooner than I had intended, and you will expect me
      to-morrow. You will then enter on the ordeal you desire, but remember
      that, in doing so, you must reduce Being as far as possible into Mind. The
      senses must be mortified and subdued,&mdash;not the whisper of one passion
      heard. Thou mayst be master of the Cabala and the Chemistry; but thou must
      be master also over the Flesh and the Blood,&mdash;over Love and Vanity,
      Ambition and Hate. I will trust to find thee so. Fast and meditate till we
      meet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon crumpled the letter in his hand with a smile of disdain. What!
      more drudgery,&mdash;more abstinence! Youth without love and pleasure! Ha,
      ha! baffled Mejnour, thy pupil shall gain thy secrets without thine aid!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Fillide! I passed her cottage in my way,&mdash;she blushed and sighed
      when I jested her about you, Excellency!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Paolo! I thank thee for so charming an introduction. Thine must be
      a rare life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Excellency, while we are young, nothing like adventure,&mdash;except
      love, wine, and laughter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true. Farewell, Maestro Paolo; we will talk more with each other in
      a few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All that morning Glyndon was almost overpowered with the new sentiment of
      happiness that had entered into him. He roamed into the woods, and he felt
      a pleasure that resembled his earlier life of an artist, but a pleasure
      yet more subtle and vivid, in the various colours of the autumn foliage.
      Certainly Nature seemed to be brought closer to him; he comprehended
      better all that Mejnour had often preached to him of the mystery of
      sympathies and attractions. He was about to enter into the same law as
      those mute children of the forests. He was to know THE RENEWAL OF LIFE;
      the seasons that chilled to winter should yet bring again the bloom and
      the mirth of spring. Man&rsquo;s common existence is as one year to the
      vegetable world: he has his spring, his summer, his autumn, and winter,&mdash;but
      only ONCE. But the giant oaks round him go through a revolving series of
      verdure and youth, and the green of the centenarian is as vivid in the
      beams of May as that of the sapling by its side. &ldquo;Mine shall be your
      spring, but not your winter!&rdquo; exclaimed the aspirant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wrapped in these sanguine and joyous reveries, Glyndon, quitting the
      woods, found himself amidst cultivated fields and vineyards to which his
      footstep had not before wandered; and there stood, by the skirts of a
      green lane that reminded him of verdant England, a modest house,&mdash;half
      cottage, half farm. The door was open, and he saw a girl at work with her
      distaff. She looked up, uttered a slight cry, and, tripping gayly into the
      lane to his side, he recognised the dark-eyed Fillide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; she said, archly putting her finger to her lip; &ldquo;do not speak
      loud,&mdash;my mother is asleep within; and I knew you would come to see
      me. It is kind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon, with a little embarrassment, accepted the compliment to his
      kindness, which he did not exactly deserve. &ldquo;You have thought, then, of
      me, fair Fillide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the girl, colouring, but with that frank, bold
      ingenuousness, which characterises the females of Italy, especially of the
      lower class, and in the southern provinces,&mdash;&ldquo;oh, yes! I have thought
      of little else. Paolo said he knew you would visit me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what relation is Paolo to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None; but a good friend to us all. My brother is one of his band.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of his band!&mdash;a robber?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We of the mountains do not call a mountaineer &lsquo;a robber,&rsquo; signor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask pardon. Do you not tremble sometimes for your brother&rsquo;s life? The
      law&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Law never ventures into these defiles. Tremble for him! No. My father and
      grandsire were of the same calling. I often wish I were a man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By these lips, I am enchanted that your wish cannot be realised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fie, signor! And do you really love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With my whole heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I thee!&rdquo; said the girl, with a candour that seemed innocent, as she
      suffered him to clasp her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;thou wilt soon leave us; and I&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped
      short, and the tears stood in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something dangerous in this, it must be confessed. Certainly
      Fillide had not the seraphic loveliness of Viola; but hers was a beauty
      that equally at least touched the senses. Perhaps Glyndon had never really
      loved Viola; perhaps the feelings with which she had inspired him were not
      of that ardent character which deserves the name of love. However that be,
      he thought, as he gazed on those dark eyes, that he had never loved
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And couldst thou not leave thy mountains?&rdquo; he whispered, as he drew yet
      nearer to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dost thou ask me?&rdquo; she said, retreating, and looking him steadfastly in
      the face. &ldquo;Dost thou know what we daughters of the mountains are? You gay,
      smooth cavaliers of cities seldom mean what you speak. With you, love is
      amusement; with us, it is life. Leave these mountains! Well! I should not
      leave my nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep thy nature ever,&mdash;it is a sweet one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sweet while thou art true; stern, if thou art faithless. Shall I
      tell thee what I&mdash;what the girls of this country are? Daughters of
      men whom you call robbers, we aspire to be the companions of our lovers or
      our husbands. We love ardently; we own it boldly. We stand by your side in
      danger; we serve you as slaves in safety: we never change, and we resent
      change. You may reproach, strike us, trample us as a dog,&mdash;we bear
      all without a murmur; betray us, and no tiger is more relentless. Be true,
      and our hearts reward you; be false, and our hands revenge! Dost thou love
      me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this speech the Italian&rsquo;s countenance had most eloquently aided her
      words,&mdash;by turns soft, frank, fierce,&mdash;and at the last question
      she inclined her head humbly, and stood, as in fear of his reply, before
      him. The stern, brave, wild spirit, in which what seemed unfeminine was
      yet, if I may so say, still womanly, did not recoil, it rather captivated
      Glyndon. He answered readily, briefly, and freely, &ldquo;Fillide,&mdash;yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, &ldquo;yes!&rdquo; forsooth, Clarence Glyndon! Every light nature answers &ldquo;yes&rdquo;
       lightly to such a question from lips so rosy! Have a care,&mdash;have a
      care! Why the deuce, Mejnour, do you leave your pupil of four-and-twenty
      to the mercy of these wild cats-a-mountain! Preach fast, and abstinence,
      and sublime renunciation of the cheats of the senses! Very well in you,
      sir, Heaven knows how many ages old; but at four-and-twenty, your
      Hierophant would have kept you out of Fillide&rsquo;s way, or you would have had
      small taste for the Cabala.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they stood, and talked, and vowed, and whispered, till the girl&rsquo;s
      mother made some noise within the house, and Fillide bounded back to the
      distaff, her finger once more on her lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is more magic in Fillide than in Mejnour,&rdquo; said Glyndon to himself,
      walking gayly home; &ldquo;yet on second thoughts, I know not if I quite so well
      like a character so ready for revenge. But he who has the real secret can
      baffle even the vengeance of a woman, and disarm all danger!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sirrah! dost thou even already meditate the possibility of treason? Oh,
      well said Zanoni, &ldquo;to pour pure water into the muddy well does but disturb
      the mud.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER 4.VII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Cernis, custodia qualis
     Vestibulo sedeat? facies quae limina servet?
     &ldquo;Aeneid,&rdquo; lib. vi. 574.

     (See you what porter sits within the vestibule?&mdash;what face
     watches at the threshold?)
</pre>
    <p>
      And it is profound night. All is at rest within the old castle,&mdash;all
      is breathless under the melancholy stars. Now is the time. Mejnour with
      his austere wisdom,&mdash;Mejnour the enemy to love; Mejnour, whose eye
      will read thy heart, and refuse thee the promised secrets because the
      sunny face of Fillide disturbs the lifeless shadow that he calls repose,&mdash;Mejnour
      comes to-morrow! Seize the night! Beware of fear! Never, or this hour! So,
      brave youth,&mdash;brave despite all thy errors,&mdash;so, with a steady
      pulse, thy hand unlocks once more the forbidden door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He placed his lamp on the table beside the book, which still lay there
      opened; he turned over the leaves, but could not decipher their meaning
      till he came to the following passage:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When, then, the pupil is thus initiated and prepared, let him open the
      casement, light the lamps, and bathe his temples with the elixir. He must
      beware how he presume yet to quaff the volatile and fiery spirit. To taste
      till repeated inhalations have accustomed the frame gradually to the
      ecstatic liquid, is to know not life, but death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could penetrate no farther into the instructions; the cipher again
      changed. He now looked steadily and earnestly round the chamber. The
      moonlight came quietly through the lattice as his hand opened it, and
      seemed, as it rested on the floor, and filled the walls, like the presence
      of some ghostly and mournful Power. He ranged the mystic lamps (nine in
      number) round the centre of the room, and lighted them one by one. A flame
      of silvery and azure tints sprung up from each, and lighted the apartment
      with a calm and yet most dazzling splendour; but presently this light grew
      more soft and dim, as a thin, grey cloud, like a mist, gradually spread
      over the room; and an icy thrill shot through the heart of the Englishman,
      and quickly gathered over him like the coldness of death. Instinctively
      aware of his danger, he tottered, though with difficulty, for his limbs
      seemed rigid and stone-like, to the shelf that contained the crystal
      vials; hastily he inhaled the spirit, and laved his temples with the
      sparkling liquid. The same sensation of vigour and youth, and joy and airy
      lightness, that he had felt in the morning, instantaneously replaced the
      deadly numbness that just before had invaded the citadel of life. He
      stood, with his arms folded on his bosom erect and dauntless, to watch
      what should ensue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vapour had now assumed almost the thickness and seeming consistency of
      a snow-cloud; the lamps piercing it like stars. And now he distinctly saw
      shapes, somewhat resembling in outline those of the human form, gliding
      slowly and with regular evolutions through the cloud. They appeared
      bloodless; their bodies were transparent, and contracted or expanded like
      the folds of a serpent. As they moved in majestic order, he heard a low
      sound&mdash;the ghost, as it were, of voice&mdash;which each caught and
      echoed from the other; a low sound, but musical, which seemed the chant of
      some unspeakably tranquil joy. None of these apparitions heeded him. His
      intense longing to accost them, to be of them, to make one of this
      movement of aerial happiness,&mdash;for such it seemed to him,&mdash;made
      him stretch forth his arms and seek to cry aloud, but only an inarticulate
      whisper passed his lips; and the movement and the music went on the same
      as if the mortal were not there. Slowly they glided round and aloft, till,
      in the same majestic order, one after one, they floated through the
      casement and were lost in the moonlight; then, as his eyes followed them,
      the casement became darkened with some object undistinguishable at the
      first gaze, but which sufficed mysteriously to change into ineffable
      horror the delight he had before experienced. By degrees this object
      shaped itself to his sight. It was as that of a human head covered with a
      dark veil through which glared, with livid and demoniac fire, eyes that
      froze the marrow of his bones. Nothing else of the face was
      distinguishable,&mdash;nothing but those intolerable eyes; but his terror,
      that even at the first seemed beyond nature to endure, was increased a
      thousand-fold, when, after a pause, the phantom glided slowly into the
      chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cloud retreated from it as it advanced; the bright lamps grew wan, and
      flickered restlessly as at the breath of its presence. Its form was veiled
      as the face, but the outline was that of a female; yet it moved not as
      move even the ghosts that simulate the living. It seemed rather to crawl
      as some vast misshapen reptile; and pausing, at length it cowered beside
      the table which held the mystic volume, and again fixed its eyes through
      the filmy veil on the rash invoker. All fancies, the most grotesque, of
      monk or painter in the early North, would have failed to give to the
      visage of imp or fiend that aspect of deadly malignity which spoke to the
      shuddering nature in those eyes alone. All else so dark,&mdash;shrouded,
      veiled and larva-like. But that burning glare so intense, so livid, yet so
      living, had in it something that was almost HUMAN in its passion of hate
      and mockery,&mdash;something that served to show that the shadowy Horror
      was not all a spirit, but partook of matter enough, at least, to make it
      more deadly and fearful an enemy to material forms. As, clinging with the
      grasp of agony to the wall,&mdash;his hair erect, his eyeballs starting,
      he still gazed back upon that appalling gaze,&mdash;the Image spoke to
      him: his soul rather than his ear comprehended the words it said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hast entered the immeasurable region. I am the Dweller of the
      Threshold. What wouldst thou with me? Silent? Dost thou fear me? Am I not
      thy beloved? Is it not for me that thou hast rendered up the delights of
      thy race? Wouldst thou be wise? Mine is the wisdom of the countless ages.
      Kiss me, my mortal lover.&rdquo; And the Horror crawled near and nearer to him;
      it crept to his side, its breath breathed upon his cheek! With a sharp cry
      he fell to the earth insensible, and knew no more till, far in the noon of
      the next day, he opened his eyes and found himself in his bed,&mdash;the
      glorious sun streaming through his lattice, and the bandit Paolo by his
      side, engaged in polishing his carbine, and whistling a Calabrian
      love-air.

      CHAPTER 4.VIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Thus man pursues his weary calling,
     And wrings the hard life from the sky,
     While happiness unseen is falling
     Down from God&rsquo;s bosom silently.
     &mdash;Schiller.
</pre>
    <p>
      In one of those islands whose history the imperishable literature and
      renown of Athens yet invest with melancholy interest, and on which Nature,
      in whom &ldquo;there is nothing melancholy,&rdquo; still bestows a glory of scenery
      and climate equally radiant for the freeman or the slave,&mdash;the
      Ionian, the Venetian, the Gaul, the Turk, or the restless Briton,&mdash;Zanoni
      had fixed his bridal home. There the air carries with it the perfumes of
      the plains for miles along the blue, translucent deep. (See Dr. Holland&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;Travels to the Ionian Isles,&rdquo; etc., page 18.) Seen from one of its green
      sloping heights, the island he had selected seemed one delicious garden.
      The towers and turrets of its capital gleaming amidst groves of oranges
      and lemons; vineyards and olive-woods filling up the valleys, and
      clambering along the hill-sides; and villa, farm, and cottage covered with
      luxuriant trellises of dark-green leaves and purple fruit. For there the
      prodigal beauty yet seems half to justify those graceful superstitions of
      a creed that, too enamoured of earth, rather brought the deities to man,
      than raised the man to their less alluring and less voluptuous Olympus.
    </p>
    <p>
      And still to the fishermen, weaving yet their antique dances on the sand;
      to the maiden, adorning yet, with many a silver fibula, her glossy tresses
      under the tree that overshadows her tranquil cot,&mdash;the same Great
      Mother that watched over the wise of Samos, the democracy of Corcyra, the
      graceful and deep-taught loveliness of Miletus, smiles as graciously as of
      yore. For the North, philosophy and freedom are essentials to human
      happiness; in the lands which Aphrodite rose from the waves to govern, as
      the Seasons, hand in hand, stood to welcome her on the shores, Nature is
      all sufficient. (Homeric Hymn.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The isle which Zanoni had selected was one of the loveliest in that divine
      sea. His abode, at some distance from the city, but near one of the creeks
      on the shore, belonged to a Venetian, and, though small, had more of
      elegance than the natives ordinarily cared for. On the seas, and in sight,
      rode his vessel. His Indians, as before, ministered in mute gravity to the
      service of the household. No spot could be more beautiful,&mdash;no
      solitude less invaded. To the mysterious knowledge of Zanoni, to the
      harmless ignorance of Viola, the babbling and garish world of civilised
      man was alike unheeded. The loving sky and the lovely earth are companions
      enough to Wisdom and to Ignorance while they love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although, as I have before said, there was nothing in the visible
      occupations of Zanoni that betrayed a cultivator of the occult sciences,
      his habits were those of a man who remembers or reflects. He loved to roam
      alone, chiefly at dawn, or at night, when the moon was clear (especially
      in each month, at its rise and full), miles and miles away over the rich
      inlands of the island, and to cull herbs and flowers, which he hoarded
      with jealous care. Sometimes, at the dead of night, Viola would wake by an
      instinct that told her he was not by her side, and, stretching out her
      arms, find that the instinct had not deceived her. But she early saw that
      he was reserved on his peculiar habits; and if at times a chill, a
      foreboding, a suspicious awe crept over her, she forebore to question him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his rambles were not always unaccompanied,&mdash;he took pleasure in
      excursions less solitary. Often, when the sea lay before them like a lake,
      the barren dreariness of the opposite coast of Cephallenia contrasting the
      smiling shores on which they dwelt, Viola and himself would pass days in
      cruising slowly around the coast, or in visits to the neighbouring isles.
      Every spot of the Greek soil, &ldquo;that fair Fable-Land,&rdquo; seemed to him
      familiar; and as he conversed of the past and its exquisite traditions, he
      taught Viola to love the race from which have descended the poetry and the
      wisdom of the world. There was much in Zanoni, as she knew him better,
      that deepened the fascination in which Viola was from the first
      enthralled. His love for herself was so tender, so vigilant, and had that
      best and most enduring attribute, that it seemed rather grateful for the
      happiness in its own cares than vain of the happiness it created. His
      habitual mood with all who approached him was calm and gentle, almost to
      apathy. An angry word never passed his lips,&mdash;an angry gleam never
      shot from his eyes. Once they had been exposed to the danger not uncommon
      in those then half-savage lands. Some pirates who infested the
      neighbouring coasts had heard of the arrival of the strangers, and the
      seamen Zanoni employed had gossiped of their master&rsquo;s wealth. One night,
      after Viola had retired to rest, she was awakened by a slight noise below.
      Zanoni was not by her side; she listened in some alarm. Was that a groan
      that came upon her ear? She started up, she went to the door; all was
      still. A footstep now slowly approached, and Zanoni entered calm as usual,
      and seemed unconscious of her fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning three men were found dead at the threshold of the
      principal entrance, the door of which had been forced. They were
      recognised in the neighbourhood as the most sanguinary and terrible
      marauders of the coasts,&mdash;men stained with a thousand murders, and
      who had never hitherto failed in any attempt to which the lust of rapine
      had impelled them. The footsteps of many others were tracked to the
      seashore. It seemed that their accomplices must have fled on the death of
      their leaders. But when the Venetian Proveditore, or authority, of the
      island, came to examine into the matter, the most unaccountable mystery
      was the manner in which these ruffians had met their fate. Zanoni had not
      stirred from the apartment in which he ordinarily pursued his chemical
      studies. None of the servants had even been disturbed from their slumbers.
      No marks of human violence were on the bodies of the dead. They died, and
      made no sign. From that moment Zanoni&rsquo;s house&mdash;nay, the whole
      vicinity&mdash;was sacred. The neighbouring villages, rejoiced to be
      delivered from a scourge, regarded the stranger as one whom the Pagiana
      (or Virgin) held under her especial protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, the lively Greeks around, facile to all external impressions,
      and struck with the singular and majestic beauty of the man who knew their
      language as a native, whose voice often cheered them in their humble
      sorrows, and whose hand was never closed to their wants, long after he had
      left their shore preserved his memory by grateful traditions, and still
      point to the lofty platanus beneath which they had often seen him seated,
      alone and thoughtful, in the heats of noon. But Zanoni had haunts less
      open to the gaze than the shade of the platanus. In that isle there are
      the bituminous springs which Herodotus has commemorated. Often at night,
      the moon, at least, beheld him emerging from the myrtle and cystus that
      clothe the hillocks around the marsh that imbeds the pools containing the
      inflammable materia, all the medical uses of which, as applied to the
      nerves of organic life, modern science has not yet perhaps explored. Yet
      more often would he pass his hours in a cavern, by the loneliest part of
      the beach, where the stalactites seem almost arranged by the hand of art,
      and which the superstition of the peasants associates, in some ancient
      legends, with the numerous and almost incessant earthquakes to which the
      island is so singularly subjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the pursuits that instigated these wanderings and favoured these
      haunts, either they were linked with, or else subordinate to, one main and
      master desire, which every fresh day passed in the sweet human company of
      Viola confirmed and strengthened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene that Glyndon had witnessed in his trance was faithful to truth.
      And some little time after the date of that night, Viola was dimly aware
      that an influence, she knew not of what nature, was struggling to
      establish itself over her happy life. Visions indistinct and beautiful,
      such as those she had known in her earlier days, but more constant and
      impressive, began to haunt her night and day when Zanoni was absent, to
      fade in his presence, and seem less fair than THAT. Zanoni questioned her
      eagerly and minutely of these visitations, but seemed dissatisfied, and at
      times perplexed, by her answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me not,&rdquo; he said, one day, &ldquo;of those unconnected images, those
      evolutions of starry shapes in a choral dance, or those delicious melodies
      that seem to thee of the music and the language of the distant spheres.
      Has no ONE shape been to thee more distinct and more beautiful than the
      rest,&mdash;no voice uttering, or seeming to utter, thine own tongue, and
      whispering to thee of strange secrets and solemn knowledge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; all is confused in these dreams, whether of day or night; and when at
      the sound of thy footsteps I recover, my memory retains nothing but a
      vague impression of happiness. How different&mdash;how cold&mdash;to the
      rapture of hanging on thy smile, and listening to thy voice, when it says,
      &lsquo;I love thee!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet, how is it that visions less fair than these once seemed to thee so
      alluring? How is it that they then stirred thy fancies and filled thy
      heart? Once thou didst desire a fairy-land, and now thou seemest so
      contented with common life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not explained it to thee before? Is it common life, then, to love,
      and to live with the one we love? My true fairy-land is won! Speak to me
      of no other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so night surprised them by the lonely beach; and Zanoni, allured from
      his sublimer projects, and bending over that tender face, forgot that, in
      the Harmonious Infinite which spread around, there were other worlds than
      that one human heart.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 4.IX.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     There is a principle of the soul, superior to all nature, through
     which we are capable of surpassing the order and systems of the
     world.  When the soul is elevated to natures better than itself,
     THEN it is entirely separated from subordinate natures, exchanges
     this for another life, and, deserting the order of things with
     which it was connected, links and mingles itself with another.
     &mdash;Iamblichus.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adon-Ai! Adon-Ai!&mdash;appear, appear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in the lonely cave, whence once had gone forth the oracles of a
      heathen god, there emerged from the shadows of fantastic rocks a luminous
      and gigantic column, glittering and shifting. It resembled the shining but
      misty spray which, seen afar off, a fountain seems to send up on a starry
      night. The radiance lit the stalactites, the crags, the arches of the
      cave, and shed a pale and tremulous splendour on the features of Zanoni.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Son of Eternal Light,&rdquo; said the invoker, &ldquo;thou to whose knowledge, grade
      after grade, race after race, I attained at last, on the broad Chaldean
      plains; thou from whom I have drawn so largely of the unutterable
      knowledge that yet eternity alone can suffice to drain; thou who,
      congenial with myself, so far as our various beings will permit, hast been
      for centuries my familiar and my friend,&mdash;answer me and counsel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the column there emerged a shape of unimaginable glory. Its face was
      that of a man in its first youth, but solemn, as with the consciousness of
      eternity and the tranquillity of wisdom; light, like starbeams, flowed
      through its transparent veins; light made its limbs themselves, and
      undulated, in restless sparkles, through the waves of its dazzling hair.
      With its arms folded on its breast, it stood distant a few feet from
      Zanoni, and its low voice murmured gently, &ldquo;My counsels were sweet to thee
      once; and once, night after night, thy soul could follow my wings through
      the untroubled splendours of the Infinite. Now thou hast bound thyself
      back to the earth by its strongest chains, and the attraction to the clay
      is more potent than the sympathies that drew to thy charms the Dweller of
      the Starbeam and the Air. When last thy soul hearkened to me, the senses
      already troubled thine intellect and obscured thy vision. Once again I
      come to thee; but thy power even to summon me to thy side is fading from
      thy spirit, as sunshine fades from the wave when the winds drive the cloud
      between the ocean and the sky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, Adon-Ai!&rdquo; answered the seer, mournfully, &ldquo;I know too well the
      conditions of the being which thy presence was wont to rejoice. I know
      that our wisdom comes but from the indifference to the things of the world
      which the wisdom masters. The mirror of the soul cannot reflect both earth
      and heaven; and the one vanishes from the surface as the other is glassed
      upon its deeps. But it is not to restore me to that sublime abstraction in
      which the intellect, free and disembodied, rises, region after region, to
      the spheres,&mdash;that once again, and with the agony and travail of
      enfeebled power I have called thee to mine aid. I love; and in love I
      begin to live in the sweet humanities of another. If wise, yet in all
      which makes danger powerless against myself, or those on whom I can gaze
      from the calm height of indifferent science, I am blind as the merest
      mortal to the destinies of the creature that makes my heart beat with the
      passions which obscure my gaze.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What matter!&rdquo; answered Adon-Ai. &ldquo;Thy love must be but a mockery of the
      name; thou canst not love as they do for whom there are death and the
      grave. A short time,&mdash;like a day in thy incalculable life,&mdash;and
      the form thou dotest on is dust! Others of the nether world go hand in
      hand, each with each, unto the tomb; hand in hand they ascend from the
      worm to new cycles of existence. For thee, below are ages; for her, but
      hours. And for her and thee&mdash;O poor, but mighty one!&mdash;will there
      be even a joint hereafter! Through what grades and heavens of
      spiritualised being will her soul have passed when thou, the solitary
      loiterer, comest from the vapours of the earth to the gates of light!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Son of the Starbeam, thinkest thou that this thought is not with me
      forever; and seest thou not that I have invoked thee to hearken and
      minister to my design? Readest thou not my desire and dream to raise the
      conditions of her being to my own? Thou, Adon-Ai, bathing the celestial
      joy that makes thy life in the oceans of eternal splendour,&mdash;thou,
      save by the sympathies of knowledge, canst conjecture not what I, the
      offspring of mortals, feel&mdash;debarred yet from the objects of the
      tremendous and sublime ambition that first winged my desires above the
      clay&mdash;when I see myself compelled to stand in this low world alone. I
      have sought amongst my tribe for comrades, and in vain. At last I have
      found a mate. The wild bird and the wild beast have theirs; and my mastery
      over the malignant tribes of terror can banish their larvae from the path
      that shall lead her upward, till the air of eternity fits the frame for
      the elixir that baffles death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thou hast begun the initiation, and thou art foiled! I know it. Thou
      hast conjured to her sleep the fairest visions; thou hast invoked the
      loveliest children of the air to murmur their music to her trance, and her
      soul heeds them not, and, returning to the earth, escapes from their
      control. Blind one, wherefore? canst thou not perceive? Because in her
      soul all is love. There is no intermediate passion with which the things
      thou wouldst charm to her have association and affinities. Their
      attraction is but to the desires and cravings of the INTELLECT. What have
      they with the PASSION that is of earth, and the HOPE that goes direct to
      heaven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can there be no medium&mdash;no link&mdash;in which our souls, as our
      hearts, can be united, and so mine may have influence over her own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask me not,&mdash;thou wilt not comprehend me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I adjure thee!&mdash;speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When two souls are divided, knowest thou not that a third in which both
      meet and live is the link between them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do comprehend thee, Adon-Ai,&rdquo; said Zanoni, with a light of more human
      joy upon his face than it had ever before been seen to wear; &ldquo;and if my
      destiny, which here is dark to mine eyes, vouchsafes to me the happy lot
      of the humble,&mdash;if ever there be a child that I may clasp to my bosom
      and call my own&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it to be man at last, that thou hast aspired to be more than man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a child,&mdash;a second Viola!&rdquo; murmured Zanoni, scarcely heeding the
      Son of Light; &ldquo;a young soul fresh from heaven, that I may rear from the
      first moment it touches earth,&mdash;whose wings I may train to follow
      mine through the glories of creation; and through whom the mother herself
      may be led upward over the realm of death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beware,&mdash;reflect! Knowest thou not that thy darkest enemy dwells in
      the Real? Thy wishes bring thee near and nearer to humanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, humanity is sweet!&rdquo; answered Zanoni.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as the seer spoke, on the glorious face of Adon-Ai there broke a
      smile.

      EXTRACTS FROM THE LETTERS OF ZANONI TO MEJNOUR.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letter 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thou hast not informed me of the progress of thy pupil; and I fear that so
      differently does circumstance shape the minds of the generations to which
      we are descended, from the intense and earnest children of the earlier
      world, that even thy most careful and elaborate guidance would fail, with
      loftier and purer natures than that of the neophyte thou hast admitted
      within thy gates. Even that third state of being, which the Indian sage
      (The Brahmins, speaking of Brahm, say, &ldquo;To the Omniscient the three modes
      of being&mdash;sleep, waking, and trance&mdash;are not;&rdquo; distinctly
      recognising trance as a third and coequal condition of being.) rightly
      recognises as being between the sleep and the waking, and describes
      imperfectly by the name of TRANCE, is unknown to the children of the
      Northern world; and few but would recoil to indulge it, regarding its
      peopled calm as maya and delusion of the mind. Instead of ripening and
      culturing that airy soil, from which Nature, duly known, can evoke fruits
      so rich and flowers so fair, they strive but to exclude it from their
      gaze; they esteem that struggle of the intellect from men&rsquo;s narrow world
      to the spirit&rsquo;s infinite home, as a disease which the leech must extirpate
      with pharmacy and drugs, and know not even that it is from this condition
      of their being, in its most imperfect and infant form, that poetry, music,
      art&mdash;all that belong to an Idea of Beauty to which neither SLEEPING
      nor WAKING can furnish archetype and actual semblance&mdash;take their
      immortal birth. When we, O Mejnour in the far time, were ourselves the
      neophytes and aspirants, we were of a class to which the actual world was
      shut and barred. Our forefathers had no object in life but knowledge. From
      the cradle we were predestined and reared to wisdom as to a priesthood. We
      commenced research where modern Conjecture closes its faithless wings. And
      with us, those were common elements of science which the sages of to-day
      disdain as wild chimeras, or despair of as unfathomable mysteries. Even
      the fundamental principles, the large yet simple theories of electricity
      and magnetism, rest obscure and dim in the disputes of their blinded
      schools; yet, even in our youth, how few ever attained to the first circle
      of the brotherhood, and, after wearily enjoying the sublime privileges
      they sought, they voluntarily abandoned the light of the sun, and sunk,
      without effort, to the grave, like pilgrims in a trackless desert,
      overawed by the stillness of their solitude, and appalled by the absence
      of a goal. Thou, in whom nothing seems to live BUT THE DESIRE TO KNOW;
      thou, who, indifferent whether it leads to weal or to woe, lendest thyself
      to all who would tread the path of mysterious science, a human book,
      insensate to the precepts it enounces,&mdash;thou hast ever sought, and
      often made additions to our number. But to these have only been vouchsafed
      partial secrets; vanity and passion unfitted them for the rest; and now,
      without other interest than that of an experiment in science, without
      love, and without pity, thou exposest this new soul to the hazards of the
      tremendous ordeal! Thou thinkest that a zeal so inquisitive, a courage so
      absolute and dauntless, may suffice to conquer, where austerer intellect
      and purer virtue have so often failed. Thou thinkest, too, that the germ
      of art that lies in the painter&rsquo;s mind, as it comprehends in itself the
      entire embryo of power and beauty, may be expanded into the stately flower
      of the Golden Science. It is a new experiment to thee. Be gentle with thy
      neophyte, and if his nature disappoint thee in the first stages of the
      process, dismiss him back to the Real while it is yet time to enjoy the
      brief and outward life which dwells in the senses, and closes with the
      tomb. And as I thus admonish thee, O Mejnour, wilt thou smile at my
      inconsistent hopes? I, who have so invariably refused to initiate others
      into our mysteries,&mdash;I begin at last to comprehend why the great law,
      which binds man to his kind, even when seeking most to set himself aloof
      from their condition, has made thy cold and bloodless science the link
      between thyself and thy race; why, THOU has sought converts and pupils;
      why, in seeing life after life voluntarily dropping from our starry order,
      thou still aspirest to renew the vanished, and repair the lost; why,
      amidst thy calculations, restless and unceasing as the wheels of Nature
      herself, thou recoilest from the THOUGHT TO BE ALONE! So with myself; at
      last I, too, seek a convert, an equal,&mdash;I, too, shudder to be alone!
      What thou hast warned me of has come to pass. Love reduces all things to
      itself. Either must I be drawn down to the nature of the beloved, or hers
      must be lifted to my own. As whatever belongs to true Art has always
      necessarily had attraction for US, whose very being is in the ideal whence
      Art descends, so in this fair creature I have learned, at last, the secret
      that bound me to her at the first glance. The daughter of music,&mdash;music,
      passing into her being, became poetry. It was not the stage that attracted
      her, with its hollow falsehoods; it was the land in her own fancy which
      the stage seemed to centre and represent. There the poetry found a voice,&mdash;there
      it struggled into imperfect shape; and then (that land insufficient for
      it) it fell back upon itself. It coloured her thoughts, it suffused her
      soul; it asked not words, it created not things; it gave birth but to
      emotions, and lavished itself on dreams. At last came love; and there, as
      a river into the sea, it poured its restless waves, to become mute and
      deep and still,&mdash;the everlasting mirror of the heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      And is it not through this poetry which lies within her that she may be
      led into the large poetry of the universe! Often I listen to her careless
      talk, and find oracles in its unconscious beauty, as we find strange
      virtues in some lonely flower. I see her mind ripening under my eyes; and
      in its fair fertility what ever-teeming novelties of thought! O Mejnour!
      how many of our tribe have unravelled the laws of the universe,&mdash;have
      solved the riddles of the exterior nature, and deduced the light from
      darkness! And is not the POET, who studies nothing but the human heart, a
      greater philosopher than all? Knowledge and atheism are incompatible. To
      know Nature is to know that there must be a God. But does it require this
      to examine the method and architecture of creation? Methinks, when I look
      upon a pure mind, however ignorant and childlike, that I see the August
      and Immaterial One more clearly than in all the orbs of matter which
      career at His bidding through space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rightly is it the fundamental decree of our order, that we must impart our
      secrets only to the pure. The most terrible part of the ordeal is in the
      temptations that our power affords to the criminal. If it were possible
      that a malevolent being could attain to our faculties, what disorder it
      might introduce into the globe! Happy that it is NOT possible; the
      malevolence would disarm the power. It is in the purity of Viola that I
      rely, as thou more vainly hast relied on the courage or the genius of thy
      pupils. Bear me witness, Mejnour! Never since the distant day in which I
      pierced the Arcana of our knowledge, have I ever sought to make its
      mysteries subservient to unworthy objects; though, alas! the extension of
      our existence robs us of a country and a home; though the law that places
      all science, as all art, in the abstraction from the noisy passions and
      turbulent ambition of actual life, forbids us to influence the destinies
      of nations, for which Heaven selects ruder and blinder agencies; yet,
      wherever have been my wanderings, I have sought to soften distress, and to
      convert from sin. My power has been hostile only to the guilty; and yet
      with all our lore, how in each step we are reduced to be but the permitted
      instruments of the Power that vouchsafes our own, but only to direct it.
      How all our wisdom shrinks into nought, compared with that which gives the
      meanest herb its virtues, and peoples the smallest globule with its
      appropriate world. And while we are allowed at times to influence the
      happiness of others, how mysteriously the shadows thicken round our own
      future doom! We cannot be prophets to ourselves! With what trembling hope
      I nurse the thought that I may preserve to my solitude the light of a
      living smile!

    <p>
      Deeming myself not pure enough to initiate so pure a heart, I invoke to
      her trance those fairest and most tender inhabitants of space that have
      furnished to poetry, which is the instinctive guess into creation, the
      ideas of the Glendoveer and Sylph. And these were less pure than her own
      thoughts, and less tender than her own love! They could not raise her
      above her human heart, for THAT has a heaven of its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      I have just looked on her in sleep,&mdash;I have heard her breathe my
      name. Alas! that which is so sweet to others has its bitterness to me; for
      I think how soon the time may come when that sleep will be without a
      dream,&mdash;when the heart that dictates the name will be cold, and the
      lips that utter it be dumb. What a twofold shape there is in love! If we
      examine it coarsely,&mdash;if we look but on its fleshy ties, its
      enjoyments of a moment, its turbulent fever and its dull reaction,&mdash;how
      strange it seems that this passion should be the supreme mover of the
      world; that it is this which has dictated the greatest sacrifices, and
      influenced all societies and all times; that to this the loftiest and
      loveliest genius has ever consecrated its devotion; that, but for love,
      there were no civilisation, no music, no poetry, no beauty, no life beyond
      the brute&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      But examine it in its heavenlier shape,&mdash;in its utter abnegation of
      self; in its intimate connection with all that is most delicate and subtle
      in the spirit,&mdash;its power above all that is sordid in existence; its
      mastery over the idols of the baser worship; its ability to create a
      palace of the cottage, an oasis in the desert, a summer in the Iceland,&mdash;where
      it breathes, and fertilises, and glows; and the wonder rather becomes how
      so few regard it in its holiest nature. What the sensual call its
      enjoyments, are the least of its joys. True love is less a passion than a
      symbol. Mejnour, shall the time come when I can speak to thee of Viola as
      a thing that was?

      Extract from Letter III.

    <p>
      Knowest thou that of late I have sometimes asked myself, &ldquo;Is there no
      guilt in the knowledge that has so divided us from our race?&rdquo; It is true
      that the higher we ascend the more hateful seem to us the vices of the
      short-lived creepers of the earth,&mdash;the more the sense of the
      goodness of the All-good penetrates and suffuses us, and the more
      immediately does our happiness seem to emanate from him. But, on the other
      hand, how many virtues must lie dead in those who live in the world of
      death, and refuse to die! Is not this sublime egotism, this state of
      abstraction and reverie,&mdash;this self-wrapped and self-dependent
      majesty of existence, a resignation of that nobility which incorporates
      our own welfare, our joys, our hopes, our fears with others? To live on in
      no dread of foes, undegraded by infirmity, secure through the cares, and
      free from the disease of flesh, is a spectacle that captivates our pride.
      And yet dost thou not more admire him who dies for another? Since I have
      loved her, Mejnour, it seems almost cowardice to elude the grave which
      devours the hearts that wrap us in their folds. I feel it,&mdash;the earth
      grows upon my spirit. Thou wert right; eternal age, serene and
      passionless, is a happier boon than eternal youth, with its yearnings and
      desires. Until we can be all spirit, the tranquillity of solitude must be
      indifference.

      Mejnour, awake from thine apathy,&mdash;rejoice! A new soul will be born
      to the world,&mdash;a new soul that shall call me father. Ah, if they for
      whom exist all the occupations and resources of human life,&mdash;if they
      can thrill with exquisite emotion at the thought of hailing again their
      own childhood in the faces of their children; if in that birth they are
      born once more into the holy Innocence which is the first state of
      existence; if they can feel that on man devolves almost an angel&rsquo;s duty,
      when he has a life to guide from the cradle, and a soul to nurture for the
      heaven,&mdash;what to me must be the rapture to welcome an inheritor of
      all the gifts which double themselves in being shared! How sweet the power
      to watch, and to guard,&mdash;to instil the knowledge, to avert the evil,
      and to guide back the river of life in a richer and broader and deeper
      stream to the paradise from which it flows! And beside that river our
      souls shall meet, sweet mother. Our child shall supply the sympathy that
      fails as yet; and what shape shall haunt thee, what terror shall dismay,
      when thy initiation is beside the cradle of thy child!

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     They thus beguile the way
     Untill the blustring storme is overblowne,
     When weening to returne whence they did stray,
     They cannot finde that path which first was showne,
     But wander to and fro in waies unknowne.
     &mdash;Spenser&rsquo;s &ldquo;Faerie Queene,&rdquo; book i. canto i. st. x.

    <p>
      Yes, Viola, thou art another being than when, by the threshold of thy
      Italian home, thou didst follow thy dim fancies through the Land of
      Shadow; or when thou didst vainly seek to give voice to an ideal beauty,
      on the boards where illusion counterfeits earth and heaven for an hour,
      till the weary sense, awaking, sees but the tinsel and the scene-shifter.
      Thy spirit reposes in its own happiness. Its wanderings have found a goal.
      In a moment there often dwells the sense of eternity; for when profoundly
      happy, we know that it is impossible to die. Whenever the soul FEELS
      ITSELF, it feels everlasting life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The initiation is deferred,&mdash;thy days and nights are left to no other
      visions than those with which a contented heart enchants a guileless
      fancy. Glendoveers and Sylphs, pardon me if I question whether those
      visions are not lovelier than yourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stand by the beach, and see the sun sinking into the sea. How long
      now have they dwelt on that island? What matters!&mdash;it may be months,
      or years&mdash;what matters! Why should I, or they, keep account of that
      happy time? As in the dream of a moment ages may seem to pass, so shall we
      measure transport or woe,&mdash;by the length of the dream, or the number
      of emotions that the dream involves?
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun sinks slowly down; the air is arid and oppressive; on the sea, the
      stately vessel lies motionless; on the shore, no leaf trembles on the
      trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viola drew nearer to Zanoni. A presentiment she could not define made her
      heart beat more quickly; and, looking into his face, she was struck with
      its expression: it was anxious, abstracted, perturbed. &ldquo;This stillness
      awes me,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zanoni did not seem to hear her. He muttered to himself, and his eyes
      gazed round restlessly. She knew not why, but that gaze, which seemed to
      pierce into space,&mdash;that muttered voice in some foreign language&mdash;revived
      dimly her earlier superstitions. She was more fearful since the hour when
      she knew that she was to be a mother. Strange crisis in the life of woman,
      and in her love! Something yet unborn begins already to divide her heart
      with that which had been before its only monarch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look on me, Zanoni,&rdquo; she said, pressing his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned: &ldquo;Thou art pale, Viola; thy hand trembles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true. I feel as if some enemy were creeping near us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the instinct deceives thee not. An enemy is indeed at hand. I see it
      through the heavy air; I hear it through the silence: the Ghostly One,&mdash;the
      Destroyer, the PESTILENCE! Ah, seest thou how the leaves swarm with
      insects, only by an effort visible to the eye. They follow the breath of
      the plague!&rdquo; As he spoke, a bird fell from the boughs at Viola&rsquo;s feet; it
      fluttered, it writhed an instant, and was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Viola!&rdquo; cried Zanoni, passionately, &ldquo;that is death. Dost thou not
      fear to die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To leave thee? Ah, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I could teach thee how Death may be defied; if I could arrest for
      thy youth the course of time; if I could&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused abruptly, for Viola&rsquo;s eyes spoke only terror; her cheek and lips
      were pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak not thus,&mdash;look not thus,&rdquo; she said, recoiling from him. &ldquo;You
      dismay me. Ah, speak not thus, or I should tremble,&mdash;no, not for
      myself, but for thy child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy child! But wouldst thou reject for thy child the same glorious boon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zanoni!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sun has sunk from our eyes, but to rise on those of others. To
      disappear from this world is to live in the world afar. Oh, lover,&mdash;oh,
      husband!&rdquo; she continued, with sudden energy, &ldquo;tell me that thou didst but
      jest,&mdash;that thou didst but trifle with my folly! There is less terror
      in the pestilence than in thy words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanoni&rsquo;s brow darkened; he looked at her in silence for some moments, and
      then said, almost severely,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What hast thou known of me to distrust?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pardon, pardon!&mdash;nothing!&rdquo; cried Viola, throwing herself on his
      breast, and bursting into tears. &ldquo;I will not believe even thine own words,
      if they seem to wrong thee!&rdquo; He kissed the tears from her eyes, but made
      no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And ah!&rdquo; she resumed, with an enchanting and child-like smile, &ldquo;if thou
      wouldst give me a charm against the pestilence! see, I will take it from
      thee.&rdquo; And she laid her hand on a small, antique amulet that he wore on
      his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou knowest how often this has made me jealous of the past; surely some
      love-gift, Zanoni? But no, thou didst not love the giver as thou dost me.
      Shall I steal thine amulet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Infant!&rdquo; said Zanoni, tenderly; &ldquo;she who placed this round my neck deemed
      it indeed a charm, for she had superstitions like thyself; but to me it is
      more than the wizard&rsquo;s spell,&mdash;it is the relic of a sweet vanished
      time when none who loved me could distrust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said these words in a tone of such melancholy reproach that it went to
      the heart of Viola; but the tone changed into a solemnity which chilled
      back the gush of her feelings as he resumed: &ldquo;And this, Viola, one day,
      perhaps, I will transfer from my breast to thine; yes, whenever thou shalt
      comprehend me better,&mdash;WHENEVER THE LAWS OF OUR BEING SHALL BE THE
      SAME!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved on gently. They returned slowly home; but fear still was in the
      heart of Viola, though she strove to shake it off. Italian and Catholic
      she was, with all the superstitions of land and sect. She stole to her
      chamber and prayed before a little relic of San Gennaro, which the priest
      of her house had given to her in childhood, and which had accompanied her
      in all her wanderings. She had never deemed it possible to part with it
      before. Now, if there was a charm against the pestilence, did she fear the
      pestilence for herself? The next morning, when he awoke, Zanoni found the
      relic of the saint suspended with his mystic amulet round his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! thou wilt have nothing to fear from the pestilence now,&rdquo; said Viola,
      between tears and smiles; &ldquo;and when thou wouldst talk to me again as thou
      didst last night, the saint shall rebuke thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, Zanoni, can there ever indeed be commune of thought and spirit,
      except with equals?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the plague broke out,&mdash;the island home must be abandoned. Mighty
      Seer, THOU HAST NO POWER TO SAVE THOSE WHOM THOU LOVEST! Farewell, thou
      bridal roof!&mdash;sweet resting-place from care, farewell! Climates as
      soft may greet ye, O lovers,&mdash;skies as serene, and waters as blue and
      calm; but THAT TIME,&mdash;can it ever more return? Who shall say that the
      heart does not change with the scene,&mdash;the place where we first dwelt
      with the beloved one? Every spot THERE has so many memories which the
      place only can recall. The past that haunts it seems to command such
      constancy in the future. If a thought less kind, less trustful, enter
      within us, the sight of a tree under which a vow has been exchanged, a
      tear has been kissed away, restores us again to the hours of the first
      divine illusion. But in a home where nothing speaks of the first nuptials,
      where there is no eloquence of association, no holy burial-places of
      emotions, whose ghosts are angels!&mdash;yes, who that has gone through
      the sad history of affection will tell us that the heart changes not with
      the scene! Blow fair, ye favouring winds; cheerily swell, ye sails; away
      from the land where death has come to snatch the sceptre of Love! The
      shores glide by; new coasts succeed to the green hills and orange-groves
      of the Bridal Isle. From afar now gleam in the moonlight the columns, yet
      extant, of a temple which the Athenian dedicated to wisdom; and, standing
      on the bark that bounded on in the freshening gale, the votary who had
      survived the goddess murmured to himself,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has the wisdom of ages brought me no happier hours than those common to
      the shepherd and the herdsman, with no world beyond their village, no
      aspiration beyond the kiss and the smile of home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the moon, resting alike over the ruins of the temple of the departed
      creed, over the hut of the living peasant, over the immemorial
      mountain-top, and the perishable herbage that clothed its sides, seemed to
      smile back its answer of calm disdain to the being who, perchance, might
      have seen the temple built, and who, in his inscrutable existence, might
      behold the mountain shattered from its base.

    <p>
      It will be remembered that we left Master Paolo by the bedside of Glyndon;
      and as, waking from that profound slumber, the recollections of the past
      night came horribly back to his mind, the Englishman uttered a cry, and
      covered his face with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morrow, Excellency!&rdquo; said Paolo, gayly. &ldquo;Corpo di Bacco, you have
      slept soundly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sound of this man&rsquo;s voice, so lusty, ringing, and healthful, served to
      scatter before it the phantasma that yet haunted Glyndon&rsquo;s memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose erect in his bed. &ldquo;And where did you find me? Why are you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did I find you!&rdquo; repeated Paolo, in surprise,&mdash;&ldquo;in your bed,
      to be sure. Why am I here!&mdash;because the Padrone bade me await your
      waking, and attend your commands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Padrone, Mejnour!&mdash;is he arrived?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrived and departed, signor. He has left this letter for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it me, and wait without till I am dressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your service. I have bespoke an excellent breakfast: you must be
      hungry. I am a very tolerable cook; a monk&rsquo;s son ought to be! You will be
      startled at my genius in the dressing of fish. My singing, I trust, will
      not disturb you. I always sing while I prepare a salad; it harmonises the
      ingredients.&rdquo; And slinging his carbine over his shoulder, Paolo sauntered
      from the room, and closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon was already deep in the contents of the following letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I first received thee as my pupil, I promised Zanoni, if convinced
      by thy first trials that thou couldst but swell, not the number of our
      order, but the list of the victims who have aspired to it in vain, I would
      not rear thee to thine own wretchedness and doom,&mdash;I would dismiss
      thee back to the world. I fulfil my promise. Thine ordeal has been the
      easiest that neophyte ever knew. I asked for nothing but abstinence from
      the sensual, and a brief experiment of thy patience and thy faith. Go back
      to thine own world; thou hast no nature to aspire to ours!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was I who prepared Paolo to receive thee at the revel. It was I who
      instigated the old beggar to ask thee for alms. It was I who left open the
      book that thou couldst not read without violating my command. Well, thou
      hast seen what awaits thee at the threshold of knowledge. Thou hast
      confronted the first foe that menaces him whom the senses yet grasp and
      inthrall. Dost thou wonder that I close upon thee the gates forever? Dost
      thou not comprehend, at last, that it needs a soul tempered and purified
      and raised, not by external spells, but by its own sublimity and valour,
      to pass the threshold and disdain the foe? Wretch! all my silence avails
      nothing for the rash, for the sensual,&mdash;for him who desires our
      secrets but to pollute them to gross enjoyments and selfish vice. How have
      the imposters and sorcerers of the earlier times perished by their very
      attempt to penetrate the mysteries that should purify, and not deprave!
      They have boasted of the Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone, and died in rags; of the
      immortal elixir, and sunk to their grave, grey before their time. Legends
      tell you that the fiend rent them into fragments. Yes; the fiend of their
      own unholy desires and criminal designs! What they coveted, thou covetest;
      and if thou hadst the wings of a seraph thou couldst soar not from the
      slough of thy mortality. Thy desire for knowledge, but petulant
      presumption; thy thirst for happiness, but the diseased longing for the
      unclean and muddied waters of corporeal pleasure; thy very love, which
      usually elevates even the mean, a passion that calculates treason amidst
      the first glow of lust. THOU one of us; thou a brother of the August
      Order; thou an Aspirant to the Stars that shine in the Shemaia of the
      Chaldean lore! The eagle can raise but the eaglet to the sun. I abandon
      thee to thy twilight!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, alas for thee, disobedient and profane! thou hast inhaled the
      elixir; thou hast attracted to thy presence a ghastly and remorseless foe.
      Thou thyself must exorcise the phantom thou hast raised. Thou must return
      to the world; but not without punishment and strong effort canst thou
      regain the calm and the joy of the life thou hast left behind. This, for
      thy comfort, will I tell thee: he who has drawn into his frame even so
      little of the volatile and vital energy of the aerial juices as thyself,
      has awakened faculties that cannot sleep,&mdash;faculties that may yet,
      with patient humility, with sound faith, and the courage that is not of
      the body like thine, but of the resolute and virtuous mind, attain, if not
      to the knowledge that reigns above, to high achievement in the career of
      men. Thou wilt find the restless influence in all that thou wouldst
      undertake. Thy heart, amidst vulgar joys will aspire to something holier;
      thy ambition, amidst coarse excitement, to something beyond thy reach. But
      deem not that this of itself will suffice for glory. Equally may the
      craving lead thee to shame and guilt. It is but an imperfect and new-born
      energy which will not suffer thee to repose. As thou directest it, must
      thou believe it to be the emanation of thine evil genius or thy good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But woe to thee! insect meshed in the web in which thou hast entangled
      limbs and wings! Thou hast not only inhaled the elixir, thou hast conjured
      the spectre; of all the tribes of the space, no foe is so malignant to
      man,&mdash;and thou hast lifted the veil from thy gaze. I cannot restore
      to thee the happy dimness of thy vision. Know, at least, that all of us&mdash;the
      highest and the wisest&mdash;who have, in sober truth, passed beyond the
      threshold, have had, as our first fearful task, to master and subdue its
      grisly and appalling guardian. Know that thou CANST deliver thyself from
      those livid eyes,&mdash;know that, while they haunt, they cannot harm, if
      thou resistest the thoughts to which they tempt, and the horror they
      engender. DREAD THEM MOST WHEN THOU BEHOLDEST THEM NOT. And thus, son of
      the worm, we part! All that I can tell thee to encourage, yet to warn and
      to guide, I have told thee in these lines. Not from me, from thyself has
      come the gloomy trial from which I yet trust thou wilt emerge into peace.
      Type of the knowledge that I serve, I withhold no lesson from the pure
      aspirant; I am a dark enigma to the general seeker. As man&rsquo;s only
      indestructible possession is his memory, so it is not in mine art to
      crumble into matter the immaterial thoughts that have sprung up within thy
      breast. The tyro might shatter this castle to the dust, and topple down
      the mountain to the plain. The master has no power to say, &lsquo;Exist no
      more,&rsquo; to one THOUGHT that his knowledge has inspired. Thou mayst change
      the thoughts into new forms; thou mayst rarefy and sublimate it into a
      finer spirit,&mdash;but thou canst not annihilate that which has no home
      but in the memory, no substance but the idea. EVERY THOUGHT IS A SOUL!
      Vainly, therefore, would I or thou undo the past, or restore to thee the
      gay blindness of thy youth. Thou must endure the influence of the elixir
      thou hast inhaled; thou must wrestle with the spectre thou hast invoked!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The letter fell from Glyndon&rsquo;s hand. A sort of stupor succeeded to the
      various emotions which had chased each other in the perusal,&mdash;a
      stupor resembling that which follows the sudden destruction of any ardent
      and long-nursed hope in the human heart, whether it be of love, of
      avarice, of ambition. The loftier world for which he had so thirsted,
      sacrificed, and toiled, was closed upon him &ldquo;forever,&rdquo; and by his own
      faults of rashness and presumption. But Glyndon&rsquo;s was not of that nature
      which submits long to condemn itself. His indignation began to kindle
      against Mejnour, who owned he had tempted, and who now abandoned him,&mdash;abandoned
      him to the presence of a spectre. The mystic&rsquo;s reproaches stung rather
      than humbled him. What crime had he committed to deserve language so harsh
      and disdainful? Was it so deep a debasement to feel pleasure in the smile
      and the eyes of Fillide? Had not Zanoni himself confessed love for Viola;
      had he not fled with her as his companion? Glyndon never paused to
      consider if there are no distinctions between one kind of love and
      another. Where, too, was the great offence of yielding to a temptation
      which only existed for the brave? Had not the mystic volume which Mejnour
      had purposely left open, bid him but &ldquo;Beware of fear&rdquo;? Was not, then,
      every wilful provocative held out to the strongest influences of the human
      mind, in the prohibition to enter the chamber, in the possession of the
      key which excited his curiosity, in the volume which seemed to dictate the
      mode by which the curiosity was to be gratified? As rapidly these thoughts
      passed over him, he began to consider the whole conduct of Mejnour either
      as a perfidious design to entrap him to his own misery, or as the trick of
      an imposter, who knew that he could not realise the great professions he
      had made. On glancing again over the more mysterious threats and warnings
      in Mejnour&rsquo;s letter, they seemed to assume the language of mere parable
      and allegory,&mdash;the jargon of the Platonists and Pythagoreans. By
      little and little, he began to consider that the very spectra he had seen&mdash;even
      that one phantom so horrid in its aspect&mdash;were but the delusions
      which Mejnour&rsquo;s science had enable him to raise. The healthful sunlight,
      filling up every cranny in his chamber, seemed to laugh away the terrors
      of the past night. His pride and his resentment nerved his habitual
      courage; and when, having hastily dressed himself, he rejoined Paolo, it
      was with a flushed cheek and a haughty step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, Paolo,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the Padrone, as you call him, told you to expect
      and welcome me at your village feast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did so by a message from a wretched old cripple. This surprised me at
      the time, for I thought he was far distant; but these great philosophers
      make a joke of two or three hundred leagues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not tell me you had heard from Mejnour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the old cripple forbade me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you not see the man afterwards during the dance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to serve you,&rdquo; said Paolo, piling Glyndon&rsquo;s plate, and then
      filling his glass. &ldquo;I wish, signor, now the Padrone is gone,&mdash;not,&rdquo;
       added Paolo, as he cast rather a frightened and suspicious glance round
      the room, &ldquo;that I mean to say anything disrespectful of him,&mdash;I wish,
      I say, now that he is gone, that you would take pity on yourself, and ask
      your own heart what your youth was meant for? Not to bury yourself alive
      in these old ruins, and endanger body and soul by studies which I am sure
      no saint could approve of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are the saints so partial, then, to your own occupations, Master Paolo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; answered the bandit, a little confused, &ldquo;a gentleman with plenty of
      pistoles in his purse need not, of necessity, make it his profession to
      take away the pistoles of other people! It is a different thing for us
      poor rogues. After all, too, I always devote a tithe of my gains to the
      Virgin; and I share the rest charitably with the poor. But eat, drink,
      enjoy yourself; be absolved by your confessor for any little peccadilloes
      and don&rsquo;t run too long scores at a time,&mdash;that&rsquo;s my advice. Your
      health, Excellency! Pshaw, signor, fasting, except on the days prescribed
      to a good Catholic, only engenders phantoms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phantoms!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; the devil always tempts the empty stomach. To covet, to hate, to
      thieve, to rob, and to murder,&mdash;these are the natural desires of a
      man who is famishing. With a full belly, signor, we are at peace with all
      the world. That&rsquo;s right; you like the partridge! Cospetto! when I myself
      have passed two or three days in the mountains, with nothing from sunset
      to sunrise but a black crust and an onion, I grow as fierce as a wolf.
      That&rsquo;s not the worst, too. In these times I see little imps dancing before
      me. Oh, yes; fasting is as full of spectres as a field of battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon thought there was some sound philosophy in the reasoning of his
      companion; and certainly the more he ate and drank, the more the
      recollection of the past night and of Mejnour&rsquo;s desertion faded from his
      mind. The casement was open, the breeze blew, the sun shone,&mdash;all
      Nature was merry; and merry as Nature herself grew Maestro Paolo. He
      talked of adventures, of travel, of women, with a hearty gusto that had
      its infection. But Glyndon listened yet more complacently when Paolo
      turned with an arch smile to praises of the eye, the teeth, the ankles,
      and the shape of the handsome Fillide.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man, indeed, seemed the very personation of animal sensual life. He
      would have been to Faust a more dangerous tempter than Mephistopheles.
      There was no sneer on HIS lip at the pleasures which animated his voice.
      To one awaking to a sense of the vanities in knowledge, this reckless
      ignorant joyousness of temper was a worse corrupter than all the icy
      mockeries of a learned Fiend. But when Paolo took his leave, with a
      promise to return the next day, the mind of the Englishman again settled
      back to a graver and more thoughtful mood. The elixir seemed, in truth, to
      have left the refining effects Mejnour had ascribed to it. As Glyndon
      paced to and fro the solitary corridor, or, pausing, gazed upon the
      extended and glorious scenery that stretched below, high thoughts of
      enterprise and ambition&mdash;bright visions of glory&mdash;passed in
      rapid succession through his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mejnour denies me his science. Well,&rdquo; said the painter, proudly, &ldquo;he has
      not robbed me of my art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What! Clarence Glyndon, dost thou return to that from which thy career
      commenced? Was Zanoni right after all?
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself in the chamber of the mystic; not a vessel,&mdash;not an
      herb! the solemn volume is vanished,&mdash;the elixir shall sparkle for
      him no more! But still in the room itself seems to linger the atmosphere
      of a charm. Faster and fiercer it burns within thee, the desire to
      achieve, to create! Thou longest for a life beyond the sensual!&mdash;but
      the life that is permitted to all genius,&mdash;that which breathes
      through the immortal work, and endures in the imperishable name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where are the implements for thine art? Tush!&mdash;when did the true
      workman ever fail to find his tools? Thou art again in thine own chamber,&mdash;the
      white wall thy canvas, a fragment of charcoal for thy pencil. They
      suffice, at least, to give outline to the conception that may otherwise
      vanish with the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea that thus excited the imagination of the artist was
      unquestionably noble and august. It was derived from that Egyptian
      ceremonial which Diodorus has recorded,&mdash;the Judgment of the Dead by
      the Living (Diod., lib. i.): when the corpse, duly embalmed, is placed by
      the margin of the Acherusian Lake; and before it may be consigned to the
      bark which is to bear it across the waters to its final resting-place, it
      is permitted to the appointed judges to hear all accusations of the past
      life of the deceased, and, if proved, to deprive the corpse of the rites
      of sepulture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unconsciously to himself, it was Mejnour&rsquo;s description of this custom,
      which he had illustrated by several anecdotes not to be found in books,
      that now suggested the design to the artist, and gave it reality and
      force. He supposed a powerful and guilty king whom in life scarce a
      whisper had dared to arraign, but against whom, now the breath was gone,
      came the slave from his fetters, the mutilated victim from his dungeon,
      livid and squalid as if dead themselves, invoking with parched lips the
      justice that outlives the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange fervour this, O artist! breaking suddenly forth from the mists and
      darkness which the occult science had spread so long over thy fancies,&mdash;strange
      that the reaction of the night&rsquo;s terror and the day&rsquo;s disappointment
      should be back to thine holy art! Oh, how freely goes the bold hand over
      the large outline! How, despite those rude materials, speaks forth no more
      the pupil, but the master! Fresh yet from the glorious elixir, how thou
      givest to thy creatures the finer life denied to thyself!&mdash;some power
      not thine own writes the grand symbols on the wall. Behind rises the
      mighty sepulchre, on the building of which repose to the dead the lives of
      thousands had been consumed. There sit in a semicircle the solemn judges.
      Black and sluggish flows the lake. There lies the mummied and royal dead.
      Dost thou quail at the frown on his lifelike brow? Ha!&mdash;bravely done,
      O artist!&mdash;up rise the haggard forms!&mdash;pale speak the ghastly
      faces! Shall not Humanity after death avenge itself on Power? Thy
      conception, Clarence Glyndon, is a sublime truth; thy design promises
      renown to genius. Better this magic than the charms of the volume and the
      vessel. Hour after hour has gone; thou hast lighted the lamp; night sees
      thee yet at thy labour. Merciful Heaven! what chills the atmosphere; why
      does the lamp grow wan; why does thy hair bristle? There!&mdash;there!&mdash;there!
      at the casement! It gazes on thee, the dark, mantled, loathsome thing!
      There, with their devilish mockery and hateful craft, glare on thee those
      horrid eyes!
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood and gazed,&mdash;it was no delusion. It spoke not, moved not,
      till, unable to bear longer that steady and burning look, he covered his
      face with his hands. With a start, with a thrill, he removed them; he felt
      the nearer presence of the nameless. There it cowered on the floor beside
      his design; and lo! the figures seemed to start from the wall! Those pale
      accusing figures, the shapes he himself had raised, frowned at him, and
      gibbered. With a violent effort that convulsed his whole being, and bathed
      his body in the sweat of agony, the young man mastered his horror. He
      strode towards the phantom; he endured its eyes; he accosted it with a
      steady voice; he demanded its purpose and defied its power.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, as a wind from a charnel, was heard its voice. What it said,
      what revealed, it is forbidden the lips to repeat, the hand to record.
      Nothing save the subtle life that yet animated the frame to which the
      inhalations of the elixir had given vigour and energy beyond the strength
      of the strongest, could have survived that awful hour. Better to wake in
      the catacombs and see the buried rise from their cerements, and hear the
      ghouls, in their horrid orgies, amongst the festering ghastliness of
      corruption, than to front those features when the veil was lifted, and
      listen to that whispered voice!
    </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Glyndon fled from the ruined castle. With what hopes of
      starry light had he crossed the threshold; with what memories to shudder
      evermore at the darkness did he look back at the frown of its time-worn
      towers!

     (Faust:  Whither go now!
     Mephist:  Whither it pleases thee.
     We see the small world, then the great.)
</pre>
    <p>
      Draw your chair to the fireside, brush clean the hearth, and trim the
      lights. Oh, home of sleekness, order, substance, comfort! Oh, excellent
      thing art thou, Matter of Fact!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is some time after the date of the last chapter. Here we are, not in
      moonlit islands or mouldering castles, but in a room twenty-six feet by
      twenty-two,&mdash;well carpeted, well cushioned, solid arm-chairs and
      eight such bad pictures, in such fine frames, upon the walls! Thomas
      Mervale, Esq., merchant, of London, you are an enviable dog!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the easiest thing in the world for Mervale, on returning from his
      Continental episode of life, to settle down to his desk,&mdash;his heart
      had been always there. The death of his father gave him, as a birthright,
      a high position in a respectable though second-rate firm. To make this
      establishment first-rate was an honourable ambition,&mdash;it was his! He
      had lately married, not entirely for money,&mdash;no! he was worldly
      rather than mercenary. He had no romantic ideas of love; but he was too
      sensible a man not to know that a wife should be a companion,&mdash;not
      merely a speculation. He did not care for beauty and genius, but he liked
      health and good temper, and a certain proportion of useful understanding.
      He chose a wife from his reason, not his heart, and a very good choice he
      made. Mrs. Mervale was an excellent young woman,&mdash;bustling, managing,
      economical, but affectionate and good. She had a will of her own, but was
      no shrew. She had a great notion of the rights of a wife, and a strong
      perception of the qualities that insure comfort. She would never have
      forgiven her husband, had she found him guilty of the most passing fancy
      for another; but, in return, she had the most admirable sense of propriety
      herself. She held in abhorrence all levity, all flirtation, all coquetry,&mdash;small
      vices which often ruin domestic happiness, but which a giddy nature incurs
      without consideration. But she did not think it right to love a husband
      over much. She left a surplus of affection, for all her relations, all her
      friends, some of her acquaintances, and the possibility of a second
      marriage, should any accident happen to Mr. M. She kept a good table, for
      it suited their station; and her temper was considered even, though firm;
      but she could say a sharp thing or two, if Mr. Mervale was not punctual to
      a moment. She was very particular that he should change his shoes on
      coming home,&mdash;the carpets were new and expensive. She was not sulky,
      nor passionate,&mdash;Heaven bless her for that!&mdash;but when displeased
      she showed it, administered a dignified rebuke, alluded to her own
      virtues, to her uncle who was an admiral, and to the thirty thousand
      pounds which she had brought to the object of her choice. But as Mr.
      Mervale was a good-humoured man, owned his faults, and subscribed to her
      excellence, the displeasure was soon over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every household has its little disagreements, none fewer than that of Mr.
      and Mrs. Mervale. Mrs. Mervale, without being improperly fond of dress,
      paid due attention to it. She was never seen out of her chamber with
      papers in her hair, nor in that worst of dis-illusions,&mdash;a morning
      wrapper. At half-past eight every morning Mrs. Mervale was dressed for the
      day,&mdash;that is, till she re-dressed for dinner,&mdash;her stays well
      laced, her cap prim, her gowns, winter and summer, of a thick, handsome
      silk. Ladies at that time wore very short waists; so did Mrs. Mervale. Her
      morning ornaments were a thick, gold chain, to which was suspended a gold
      watch,&mdash;none of those fragile dwarfs of mechanism that look so pretty
      and go so ill, but a handsome repeater which chronicled Father Time to a
      moment; also a mosaic brooch; also a miniature of her uncle, the admiral,
      set in a bracelet. For the evening she had two handsome sets,&mdash;necklace,
      earrings, and bracelets complete,&mdash;one of amethysts, the other
      topazes. With these, her costume for the most part was a gold-coloured
      satin and a turban, in which last her picture had been taken. Mrs. Mervale
      had an aquiline nose, good teeth, fair hair, and light eyelashes, rather a
      high complexion, what is generally called a fine bust; full cheeks; large
      useful feet made for walking; large, white hands with filbert nails, on
      which not a speck of dust had, even in childhood, ever been known to a
      light. She looked a little older than she really was; but that might arise
      from a certain air of dignity and the aforesaid aquiline nose. She
      generally wore short mittens. She never read any poetry but Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      and Cowper&rsquo;s. She was not amused by novels, though she had no prejudice
      against them. She liked a play and a pantomime, with a slight supper
      afterwards. She did not like concerts nor operas. At the beginning of the
      winter she selected some book to read, and some piece of work to commence.
      The two lasted her till the spring, when, though she continued to work,
      she left off reading. Her favourite study was history, which she read
      through the medium of Dr. Goldsmith. Her favourite author in the belles
      lettres was, of course, Dr. Johnson. A worthier woman, or one more
      respected, was not to be found, except in an epitaph!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an autumn night. Mr. and Mrs. Mervale, lately returned from an
      excursion to Weymouth, are in the drawing-room,&mdash;&ldquo;the dame sat on
      this side, the man sat on that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I assure you, my dear, that Glyndon, with all his eccentricities,
      was a very engaging, amiable fellow. You would certainly have liked him,&mdash;all
      the women did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Thomas, you will forgive the remark,&mdash;but that expression of
      yours, &lsquo;all the WOMEN&lsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&mdash;you are right. I meant to say that he was a
      general favourite with your charming sex.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&mdash;rather a frivolous character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frivolous! no, not exactly; a little unsteady,&mdash;very odd, but
      certainly not frivolous; presumptuous and headstrong in character, but
      modest and shy in his manners, rather too much so,&mdash;just what you
      like. However, to return; I am seriously uneasy at the accounts I have
      heard of him to-day. He has been living, it seems, a very strange and
      irregular life, travelling from place to place, and must have spent
      already a great deal of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apropos of money,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mervale; &ldquo;I fear we must change our butcher;
      he is certainly in league with the cook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a pity; his beef is remarkably fine. These London servants are as
      bad as the Carbonari. But, as I was saying, poor Glyndon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here a knock was heard at the door. &ldquo;Bless me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mervale, &ldquo;it is
      past ten! Who can that possibly be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps your uncle, the admiral,&rdquo; said the husband, with a slight
      peevishness in his accent. &ldquo;He generally favours us about this hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, my love, that none of my relations are unwelcome visitors at your
      house. The admiral is a most entertaining man, and his fortune is entirely
      at his own disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one I respect more,&rdquo; said Mr. Mervale, with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant threw open the door, and announced Mr. Glyndon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Glyndon!&mdash;what an extraordinary&mdash;&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Mervale;
      but before she could conclude the sentence, Glyndon was in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two friends greeted each other with all the warmth of early
      recollection and long absence. An appropriate and proud presentation to
      Mrs. Mervale ensued; and Mrs. Mervale, with a dignified smile, and a
      furtive glance at his boots, bade her husband&rsquo;s friend welcome to England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon was greatly altered since Mervale had seen him last. Though less
      than two years had elapsed since then, his fair complexion was more
      bronzed and manly. Deep lines of care, or thought, or dissipation, had
      replaced the smooth contour of happy youth. To a manner once gentle and
      polished had succeeded a certain recklessness of mien, tone, and bearing,
      which bespoke the habits of a society that cared little for the calm
      decorums of conventional ease. Still a kind of wild nobleness, not before
      apparent in him, characterised his aspect, and gave something of dignity
      to the freedom of his language and gestures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, then, you are settled, Mervale,&mdash;I need not ask you if you are
      happy. Worth, sense, wealth, character, and so fair a companion deserve
      happiness, and command it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like some tea, Mr. Glyndon?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Mervale, kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&mdash;no. I propose a more convivial stimulus to my old
      friend. Wine, Mervale,&mdash;wine, eh!&mdash;or a bowl of old English
      punch. Your wife will excuse us,&mdash;we will make a night of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mervale drew back her chair, and tried not to look aghast. Glyndon
      did not give his friend time to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So at last I am in England,&rdquo; he said, looking round the room, with a
      slight sneer on his lips; &ldquo;surely this sober air must have its influence;
      surely here I shall be like the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been ill, Glyndon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ill, yes. Humph! you have a fine house. Does it contain a spare room for
      a solitary wanderer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mervale glanced at his wife, and his wife looked steadily on the
      carpet. &ldquo;Modest and shy in his manners&mdash;rather too much so!&rdquo; Mrs.
      Mervale was in the seventh heaven of indignation and amaze!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear?&rdquo; said Mr. Mervale at last, meekly and interogatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear!&rdquo; returned Mrs. Mervale, innocently and sourly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can make up a room for my old friend, Sarah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old friend had sunk back on his chair, and, gazing intently on the
      fire, with his feet at ease upon the fender, seemed to have forgotten his
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mervale bit her lips, looked thoughtful, and at last coldly replied,
      &ldquo;Certainly, Mr. Mervale; your friends do right to make themselves at
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that she lighted a candle, and moved majestically from the room. When
      she returned, the two friends had vanished into Mr. Mervale&rsquo;s study.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twelve o&rsquo;clock struck,&mdash;one o&rsquo;clock, two! Thrice had Mrs. Mervale
      sent into the room to know,&mdash;first, if they wanted anything;
      secondly, if Mr. Glyndon slept on a mattress or feather-bed; thirdly, to
      inquire if Mr. Glyndon&rsquo;s trunk, which he had brought with him, should be
      unpacked. And to the answer to all these questions was added, in a loud
      voice from the visitor,&mdash;a voice that pierced from the kitchen to the
      attic,&mdash;&ldquo;Another bowl! stronger, if you please, and be quick with
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last Mr. Mervale appeared in the conjugal chamber, not penitent, nor
      apologetic,&mdash;no, not a bit of it. His eyes twinkled, his cheek
      flushed, his feet reeled; he sang,&mdash;Mr. Thomas Mervale positively
      sang!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Mervale! is it possible, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Old King Cole was a merry old soul&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Mervale! sir!&mdash;leave me alone, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And a merry old soul was he&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an example to the servants!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And he called for his pipe, and he called for his bowl&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t behave yourself, sir, I shall call&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Call for his fiddlers three!&rsquo;&rdquo;

      CHAPTER 5.III.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     In der Welt weit
     Aus der Einsamkeit
     Wollen sie Dich locken.
     &mdash;&ldquo;Faust.&rdquo;
 
     (In the wide world, out of the solitude, will these allure thee.)
</pre>
    <p>
      The next morning, at breakfast, Mrs. Mervale looked as if all the wrongs
      of injured woman sat upon her brow. Mr. Mervale seemed the picture of
      remorseful guilt and avenging bile. He said little, except to complain of
      headache, and to request the eggs to be removed from the table. Clarence
      Glyndon&mdash;impervious, unconscious, unailing, impenitent&mdash;was in
      noisy spirits, and talked for three.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Mervale! he has lost the habit of good-fellowship, madam. Another
      night or two, and he will be himself again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mervale, launching a premeditated sentence with more than
      Johnsonian dignity, &ldquo;permit me to remind you that Mr. Mervale is now a
      married man, the destined father of a family, and the present master of a
      household.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely the reasons why I envy him so much. I myself have a great mind
      to marry. Happiness is contagious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you still take to painting?&rdquo; asked Mervale, languidly, endeavouring to
      turn the tables on his guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; I have adopted your advice. No art, no ideal,&mdash;nothing
      loftier than Commonplace for me now. If I were to paint again, I
      positively think YOU would purchase my pictures. Make haste and finish
      your breakfast, man; I wish to consult you. I have come to England to see
      after my affairs. My ambition is to make money; your counsels and
      experience cannot fail to assist me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you were soon disenchanted of your Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone! You must
      know, Sarah, that when I last left Glyndon, he was bent upon turning
      alchemist and magician.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are witty to-day, Mr. Mervale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my honour it is true, I told you so before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon rose abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why revive those recollections of folly and presumption? Have I not said
      that I have returned to my native land to pursue the healthful avocations
      of my kind! Oh, yes! what so healthful, so noble, so fitted to our nature,
      as what you call the Practical Life? If we have faculties, what is their
      use, but to sell them to advantage! Buy knowledge as we do our goods; buy
      it at the cheapest market, sell it at the dearest. Have you not
      breakfasted yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The friends walked into the streets, and Mervale shrank from the irony
      with which Glyndon complimented him on his respectability, his station,
      his pursuits, his happy marriage, and his eight pictures in their handsome
      frames. Formerly the sober Mervale had commanded an influence over his
      friend: HIS had been the sarcasm; Glyndon&rsquo;s the irresolute shame at his
      own peculiarities. Now this position was reversed. There was a fierce
      earnestness in Glyndon&rsquo;s altered temper which awed and silenced the quiet
      commonplace of his friend&rsquo;s character. He seemed to take a malignant
      delight in persuading himself that the sober life of the world was
      contemptible and base.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;how right you were to tell me to marry respectably;
      to have a solid position; to live in decorous fear of the world and one&rsquo;s
      wife; and to command the envy of the poor, the good opinion of the rich.
      You have practised what you preach. Delicious existence! The merchant&rsquo;s
      desk and the curtain lecture! Ha! ha! Shall we have another night of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mervale, embarrassed and irritated, turned the conversation upon Glyndon&rsquo;s
      affairs. He was surprised at the knowledge of the world which the artist
      seemed to have suddenly acquired, surprised still more at the acuteness
      and energy with which he spoke of the speculations most in vogue at the
      market. Yes; Glyndon was certainly in earnest: he desired to be rich and
      respectable,&mdash;and to make at least ten per cent for his money!
    </p>
    <p>
      After spending some days with the merchant, during which time he contrived
      to disorganise all the mechanism of the house, to turn night into day,
      harmony into discord, to drive poor Mrs. Mervale half-distracted, and to
      convince her husband that he was horribly hen-pecked, the ill-omened
      visitor left them as suddenly as he had arrived. He took a house of his
      own; he sought the society of persons of substance; he devoted himself to
      the money-market; he seemed to have become a man of business; his schemes
      were bold and colossal; his calculations rapid and profound. He startled
      Mervale by his energy, and dazzled him by his success. Mervale began to
      envy him,&mdash;to be discontented with his own regular and slow gains.
      When Glyndon bought or sold in the funds, wealth rolled upon him like the
      tide of a sea; what years of toil could not have done for him in art, a
      few months, by a succession of lucky chances, did for him in speculation.
      Suddenly, however, he relaxed his exertions; new objects of ambition
      seemed to attract him. If he heard a drum in the streets, what glory like
      the soldier&rsquo;s? If a new poem were published, what renown like the poet&rsquo;s?
      He began works in literature, which promised great excellence, to throw
      them aside in disgust. All at once he abandoned the decorous and formal
      society he had courted; he joined himself, with young and riotous
      associates; he plunged into the wildest excesses of the great city, where
      Gold reigns alike over Toil and Pleasure. Through all he carried with him
      a certain power and heat of soul. In all society he aspired to command,&mdash;in
      all pursuits to excel. Yet whatever the passion of the moment, the
      reaction was terrible in its gloom. He sank, at times, into the most
      profound and the darkest reveries. His fever was that of a mind that would
      escape memory,&mdash;his repose, that of a mind which the memory seizes
      again, and devours as a prey. Mervale now saw little of him; they shunned
      each other. Glyndon had no confidant, and no friend.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 5.IV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Ich fuhle Dich mir nahe;
     Die Einsamkeit belebt;
     Wie uber seinen Welten
     Der Unsichtbare schwebt.
     Uhland.

     (I feel thee near to me,
     The loneliness takes life,&mdash;As over its world
     The Invisible hovers.)
</pre>
    <p>
      From this state of restlessness and agitation rather than continuous
      action, Glyndon was aroused by a visitor who seemed to exercise the most
      salutary influence over him. His sister, an orphan with himself, had
      resided in the country with her aunt. In the early years of hope and home
      he had loved this girl, much younger than himself, with all a brother&rsquo;s
      tenderness. On his return to England, he had seemed to forget her
      existence. She recalled herself to him on her aunt&rsquo;s death by a touching
      and melancholy letter: she had now no home but his,&mdash;no dependence
      save on his affection; he wept when he read it, and was impatient till
      Adela arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      This girl, then about eighteen, concerned beneath a gentle and calm
      exterior much of the romance or enthusiasm that had, at her own age,
      characterised her brother. But her enthusiasm was of a far purer order,
      and was restrained within proper bounds, partly by the sweetness of a very
      feminine nature, and partly by a strict and methodical education. She
      differed from him especially in a timidity of character which exceeded
      that usual at her age, but which the habit of self-command concealed no
      less carefully than that timidity itself concealed the romance I have
      ascribed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adela was not handsome: she had the complexion and the form of delicate
      health; and too fine an organisation of the nerves rendered her
      susceptible to every impression that could influence the health of the
      frame through the sympathy of the mind. But as she never complained, and
      as the singular serenity of her manners seemed to betoken an equanimity of
      temperament which, with the vulgar, might have passed for indifference,
      her sufferings had so long been borne unnoticed that it ceased to be an
      effort to disguise them. Though, as I have said, not handsome, her
      countenance was interesting and pleasing; and there was that caressing
      kindness, that winning charm about her smile, her manners, her anxiety to
      please, to comfort, and to soothe which went at once to the heart, and
      made her lovely,&mdash;because so loving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the sister whom Glyndon had so long neglected, and whom he now so
      cordially welcomed. Adela had passed many years a victim to the caprices,
      and a nurse to the maladies, of a selfish and exacting relation. The
      delicate and generous and respectful affection of her brother was no less
      new to her than delightful. He took pleasure in the happiness he created;
      he gradually weaned himself from other society; he felt the charm of home.
      It is not surprising, then, that this young creature, free and virgin from
      every more ardent attachment, concentrated all her grateful love on this
      cherished and protecting relative. Her study by day, her dream by night,
      was to repay him for his affection. She was proud of his talents, devoted
      to his welfare; the smallest trifle that could interest him swelled in her
      eyes to the gravest affairs of life. In short, all the long-hoarded
      enthusiasm, which was her perilous and only heritage, she invested in this
      one object of her holy tenderness, her pure ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in proportion as Glyndon shunned those excitements by which he had so
      long sought to occupy his time or distract his thoughts, the gloom of his
      calmer hours became deeper and more continuous. He ever and especially
      dreaded to be alone; he could not bear his new companion to be absent from
      his eyes: he rode with her, walked with her, and it was with visible
      reluctance, which almost partook of horror, that he retired to rest at an
      hour when even revel grows fatigued. This gloom was not that which could
      be called by the soft name of melancholy,&mdash;it was far more intense;
      it seemed rather like despair. Often after a silence as of death&mdash;so
      heavy, abstracted, motionless, did it appear&mdash;he would start
      abruptly, and cast hurried glances around him,&mdash;his limbs trembling,
      his lips livid, his brows bathed in dew. Convinced that some secret sorrow
      preyed upon his mind, and would consume his health, it was the dearest as
      the most natural desire of Adela to become his confidant and consoler. She
      observed, with the quick tact of the delicate, that he disliked her to
      seem affected by, or even sensible of, his darker moods. She schooled
      herself to suppress her fears and her feelings. She would not ask his
      confidence,&mdash;she sought to steal into it. By little and little she
      felt that she was succeeding. Too wrapped in his own strange existence to
      be acutely observant of the character of others, Glyndon mistook the
      self-content of a generous and humble affection for constitutional
      fortitude; and this quality pleased and soothed him. It is fortitude that
      the diseased mind requires in the confidant whom it selects as its
      physician. And how irresistible is that desire to communicate! How often
      the lonely man thought to himself, &ldquo;My heart would be lightened of its
      misery, if once confessed!&rdquo; He felt, too, that in the very youth, the
      inexperience, the poetical temperament of Adela, he could find one who
      would comprehend and bear with him better than any sterner and more
      practical nature. Mervale would have looked on his revelations as the
      ravings of madness, and most men, at best, as the sicklied chimeras, the
      optical delusions, of disease. Thus gradually preparing himself for that
      relief for which he yearned, the moment for his disclosure arrived thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, as they sat alone together, Adela, who inherited some portion
      of her brother&rsquo;s talent in art, was employed in drawing, and Glyndon,
      rousing himself from meditations less gloomy than usual, rose, and
      affectionately passing his arm round her waist, looked over her as she
      sat. An exclamation of dismay broke from his lips,&mdash;he snatched the
      drawing from her hand: &ldquo;What are you about?&mdash;what portrait is this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Clarence, do you not remember the original?&mdash;it is a copy from
      that portrait of our wise ancestor which our poor mother used to say so
      strongly resembled you. I thought it would please you if I copied it from
      memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accursed was the likeness!&rdquo; said Glyndon, gloomily. &ldquo;Guess you not the
      reason why I have shunned to return to the home of my fathers!&mdash;because
      I dreaded to meet that portrait!&mdash;because&mdash;because&mdash;but
      pardon me; I alarm you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, no,&mdash;no, Clarence, you never alarm me when you speak: only when
      you are silent! Oh, if you thought me worthy of your trust; oh, if you had
      given me the right to reason with you in the sorrows that I yearn to
      share!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon made no answer, but paced the room for some moments with
      disordered strides. He stopped at last, and gazed at her earnestly. &ldquo;Yes,
      you, too, are his descendant; you know that such men have lived and
      suffered; you will not mock me,&mdash;you will not disbelieve! Listen!
      hark!&mdash;what sound is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the wind on the house-top, Clarence,&mdash;but the wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your hand; let me feel its living clasp; and when I have told
      you, never revert to the tale again. Conceal it from all: swear that it
      shall die with us,&mdash;the last of our predestined race!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never will I betray your trust; I swear it,&mdash;never!&rdquo; said Adela,
      firmly; and she drew closer to his side. Then Glyndon commenced his story.
      That which, perhaps, in writing, and to minds prepared to question and
      disbelieve, may seem cold and terrorless, became far different when told
      by those blanched lips, with all that truth of suffering which convinces
      and appalls. Much, indeed, he concealed, much he involuntarily softened;
      but he revealed enough to make his tale intelligible and distinct to his
      pale and trembling listener. &ldquo;At daybreak,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I left that
      unhallowed and abhorred abode. I had one hope still,&mdash;I would seek
      Mejnour through the world. I would force him to lay at rest the fiend that
      haunted my soul. With this intent I journeyed from city to city. I
      instituted the most vigilant researches through the police of Italy. I
      even employed the services of the Inquisition at Rome, which had lately
      asserted its ancient powers in the trial of the less dangerous Cagliostro.
      All was in vain; not a trace of him could be discovered. I was not alone,
      Adela.&rdquo; Here Glyndon paused a moment, as if embarrassed; for in his
      recital, I need scarcely say that he had only indistinctly alluded to
      Fillide, whom the reader may surmise to be his companion. &ldquo;I was not
      alone, but the associate of my wanderings was not one in whom my soul
      could confide,&mdash;faithful and affectionate, but without education,
      without faculties to comprehend me, with natural instincts rather than
      cultivated reason; one in whom the heart might lean in its careless hours,
      but with whom the mind could have no commune, in whom the bewildered
      spirit could seek no guide. Yet in the society of this person the demon
      troubled me not. Let me explain yet more fully the dread conditions of its
      presence. In coarse excitement, in commonplace life, in the wild riot, in
      the fierce excess, in the torpid lethargy of that animal existence which
      we share with the brutes, its eyes were invisible, its whisper was
      unheard. But whenever the soul would aspire, whenever the imagination
      kindled to the loftier ends, whenever the consciousness of our proper
      destiny struggled against the unworthy life I pursued, then, Adela&mdash;then,
      it cowered by my side in the light of noon, or sat by my bed,&mdash;a
      Darkness visible through the Dark. If, in the galleries of Divine Art, the
      dreams of my youth woke the early emulation,&mdash;if I turned to the
      thoughts of sages; if the example of the great, if the converse of the
      wise, aroused the silenced intellect, the demon was with me as by a spell.
      At last, one evening, at Genoa, to which city I had travelled in pursuit
      of the mystic, suddenly, and when least expected, he appeared before me.
      It was the time of the Carnival. It was in one of those half-frantic
      scenes of noise and revel, call it not gayety, which establish a heathen
      saturnalia in the midst of a Christian festival. Wearied with the dance, I
      had entered a room in which several revellers were seated, drinking,
      singing, shouting; and in their fantastic dresses and hideous masks, their
      orgy seemed scarcely human. I placed myself amongst them, and in that
      fearful excitement of the spirits which the happy never know, I was soon
      the most riotous of all. The conversation fell on the Revolution of
      France, which had always possessed for me an absorbing fascination. The
      masks spoke of the millennium it was to bring on earth, not as
      philosophers rejoicing in the advent of light, but as ruffians exulting in
      the annihilation of law. I know not why it was, but their licentious
      language infected myself; and, always desirous to be foremost in every
      circle, I soon exceeded even these rioters in declamations on the nature
      of the liberty which was about to embrace all the families of the globe,&mdash;a
      liberty that should pervade not only public legislation, but domestic
      life; an emancipation from every fetter that men had forged for
      themselves. In the midst of this tirade one of the masks whispered me,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Take care. One listens to you who seems to be a spy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My eyes followed those of the mask, and I observed a man who took no part
      in the conversation, but whose gaze was bent upon me. He was disguised
      like the rest, yet I found by a general whisper that none had observed him
      enter. His silence, his attention, had alarmed the fears of the other
      revellers,&mdash;they only excited me the more. Rapt in my subject, I
      pursued it, insensible to the signs of those about me; and, addressing
      myself only to the silent mask who sat alone, apart from the group, I did
      not even observe that, one by one, the revellers slunk off, and that I and
      the silent listener were left alone, until, pausing from my heated and
      impetuous declamations, I said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And you, signor,&mdash;what is your view of this mighty era? Opinion
      without persecution; brotherhood without jealousy; love without bondage&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And life without God,&rsquo; added the mask as I hesitated for new images.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sound of that well-known voice changed the current of my thought. I
      sprang forward, and cried,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Imposter or Fiend, we meet at last!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The figure rose as I advanced, and, unmasking, showed the features of
      Mejnour. His fixed eye, his majestic aspect, awed and repelled me. I stood
      rooted to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said solemnly, &lsquo;we meet, and it is this meeting that I have
      sought. How hast thou followed my admonitions! Are these the scenes in
      which the Aspirant for the Serene Science thinks to escape the Ghastly
      Enemy? Do the thoughts thou hast uttered&mdash;thoughts that would strike
      all order from the universe&mdash;express the hopes of the sage who would
      rise to the Harmony of the Eternal Spheres?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It is thy fault,&mdash;it is thine!&rsquo; I exclaimed. &lsquo;Exorcise the phantom!
      Take the haunting terror from my soul!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mejnour looked at me a moment with a cold and cynical disdain which
      provoked at once my fear and rage, and replied,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No; fool of thine own senses! No; thou must have full and entire
      experience of the illusions to which the Knowledge that is without Faith
      climbs its Titan way. Thou pantest for this Millennium,&mdash;thou shalt
      behold it! Thou shalt be one of the agents of the era of Light and Reason.
      I see, while I speak, the Phantom thou fliest, by thy side; it marshals
      thy path; it has power over thee as yet,&mdash;a power that defies my own.
      In the last days of that Revolution which thou hailest, amidst the wrecks
      of the Order thou cursest as Oppression, seek the fulfilment of thy
      destiny, and await thy cure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that instant a troop of masks, clamorous, intoxicated, reeling, and
      rushing, as they reeled, poured into the room, and separated me from the
      mystic. I broke through them, and sought him everywhere, but in vain. All
      my researches the next day were equally fruitless. Weeks were consumed in
      the same pursuit,&mdash;not a trace of Mejnour could be discovered.
      Wearied with false pleasures, roused by reproaches I had deserved,
      recoiling from Mejnour&rsquo;s prophecy of the scene in which I was to seek
      deliverance, it occurred to me, at last, that in the sober air of my
      native country, and amidst its orderly and vigorous pursuits, I might work
      out my own emancipation from the spectre. I left all whom I had before
      courted and clung to,&mdash;I came hither. Amidst mercenary schemes and
      selfish speculations, I found the same relief as in debauch and excess.
      The Phantom was invisible; but these pursuits soon became to me
      distasteful as the rest. Ever and ever I felt that I was born for
      something nobler than the greed of gain,&mdash;that life may be made
      equally worthless, and the soul equally degraded by the icy lust of
      avarice, as by the noisier passions. A higher ambition never ceased to
      torment me. But, but,&rdquo; continued Glyndon, with a whitening lip and a
      visible shudder, &ldquo;at every attempt to rise into loftier existence, came
      that hideous form. It gloomed beside me at the easel. Before the volumes
      of poet and sage it stood with its burning eyes in the stillness of night,
      and I thought I heard its horrible whispers uttering temptations never to
      be divulged.&rdquo; He paused, and the drops stood upon his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I,&rdquo; said Adela, mastering her fears and throwing her arms around him,&mdash;&ldquo;but
      I henceforth will have no life but in thine. And in this love so pure, so
      holy, thy terror shall fade away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; exclaimed Glyndon, starting from her. &ldquo;The worst revelation is
      to come. Since thou hast been here, since I have sternly and resolutely
      refrained from every haunt, every scene in which this preternatural enemy
      troubled me not, I&mdash;I&mdash;have&mdash;Oh, Heaven! Mercy&mdash;mercy!
      There it stands,&mdash;there, by thy side,&mdash;there, there!&rdquo; And he
      fell to the ground insensible.

      CHAPTER 5.V.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Doch wunderbar ergriff mich&rsquo;s diese Nacht;
     Die Glieder schienen schon in Todes Macht.
     Uhland.

     (This night it fearfully seized on me; my limbs appeared already
     in the power of death.)
</pre>
    <p>
      A fever, attended with delirium, for several days deprived Glyndon of
      consciousness; and when, by Adela&rsquo;s care more than the skill of the
      physicians, he was restored to life and reason, he was unutterably shocked
      by the change in his sister&rsquo;s appearance; at first, he fondly imagined
      that her health, affected by her vigils, would recover with his own. But
      he soon saw, with an anguish which partook of remorse, that the malady was
      deep-seated,&mdash;deep, deep, beyond the reach of Aesculapius and his
      drugs. Her imagination, little less lively than his own, was awfully
      impressed by the strange confessions she had heard,&mdash;by the ravings
      of his delirium. Again and again had he shrieked forth, &ldquo;It is there,&mdash;there,
      by thy side, my sister!&rdquo; He had transferred to her fancy the spectre, and
      the horror that cursed himself. He perceived this, not by her words, but
      her silence; by the eyes that strained into space; by the shiver that came
      over her frame; by the start of terror; by the look that did not dare to
      turn behind. Bitterly he repented his confession; bitterly he felt that
      between his sufferings and human sympathy there could be no gentle and
      holy commune; vainly he sought to retract,&mdash;to undo what he had done,
      to declare all was but the chimera of an overheated brain!
    </p>
    <p>
      And brave and generous was this denial of himself; for, often and often,
      as he thus spoke, he saw the Thing of Dread gliding to her side, and
      glaring at him as he disowned its being. But what chilled him, if
      possible, yet more than her wasting form and trembling nerves, was the
      change in her love for him; a natural terror had replaced it. She turned
      paler if he approached,&mdash;she shuddered if he took her hand. Divided
      from the rest of earth, the gulf of the foul remembrance yawned now
      between his sister and himself. He could endure no more the presence of
      the one whose life HIS life had embittered. He made some excuses for
      departure, and writhed to see that they were greeted eagerly. The first
      gleam of joy he had detected since that fatal night, on Adela&rsquo;s face, he
      beheld when he murmured &ldquo;Farewell.&rdquo; He travelled for some weeks through
      the wildest parts of Scotland; scenery which MAKES the artist, was
      loveless to his haggard eyes. A letter recalled him to London on the wings
      of new agony and fear; he arrived to find his sister in a condition both
      of mind and health which exceeded his worst apprehensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her vacant look, her lifeless posture, appalled him; it was as one who
      gazed on the Medusa&rsquo;s head, and felt, without a struggle, the human being
      gradually harden to the statue. It was not frenzy, it was not idiocy,&mdash;it
      was an abstraction, an apathy, a sleep in waking. Only as the night
      advanced towards the eleventh hour&mdash;the hour in which Glyndon had
      concluded his tale&mdash;she grew visibly uneasy, anxious, and perturbed.
      Then her lips muttered; her hands writhed; she looked round with a look of
      unspeakable appeal for succour, for protection, and suddenly, as the clock
      struck, fell with a shriek to the ground, cold and lifeless. With
      difficulty, and not until after the most earnest prayers, did she answer
      the agonised questions of Glyndon; at last she owned that at that hour,
      and that hour alone, wherever she was placed, however occupied, she
      distinctly beheld the apparition of an old hag, who, after thrice knocking
      at the door, entered the room, and hobbling up to her with a countenance
      distorted by hideous rage and menace, laid its icy fingers on her
      forehead: from that moment she declared that sense forsook her; and when
      she woke again, it was only to wait, in suspense that froze up her blood,
      the repetition of the ghastly visitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician who had been summoned before Glyndon&rsquo;s return, and whose
      letter had recalled him to London, was a commonplace practitioner,
      ignorant of the case, and honestly anxious that one more experienced
      should be employed. Clarence called in one of the most eminent of the
      faculty, and to him he recited the optical delusion of his sister. The
      physician listened attentively, and seemed sanguine in his hopes of cure.
      He came to the house two hours before the one so dreaded by the patient.
      He had quietly arranged that the clocks should be put forward half an
      hour, unknown to Adela, and even to her brother. He was a man of the most
      extraordinary powers of conversation, of surpassing wit, of all the
      faculties that interest and amuse. He first administered to the patient a
      harmless potion, which he pledged himself would dispel the delusion. His
      confident tone woke her own hopes,&mdash;he continued to excite her
      attention, to rouse her lethargy; he jested, he laughed away the time. The
      hour struck. &ldquo;Joy, my brother!&rdquo; she exclaimed, throwing herself in his
      arms; &ldquo;the time is past!&rdquo; And then, like one released from a spell, she
      suddenly assumed more than her ancient cheerfulness. &ldquo;Ah, Clarence!&rdquo; she
      whispered, &ldquo;forgive me for my former desertion,&mdash;forgive me that I
      feared YOU. I shall live!&mdash;I shall live! in my turn to banish the
      spectre that haunts my brother!&rdquo; And Clarence smiled and wiped the tears
      from his burning eyes. The physician renewed his stories, his jests. In
      the midst of a stream of rich humour that seemed to carry away both
      brother and sister, Glyndon suddenly saw over Adela&rsquo;s face the same
      fearful change, the same anxious look, the same restless, straining eye,
      he had beheld the night before. He rose,&mdash;he approached her. Adela
      started up, &ldquo;look&mdash;look&mdash;look!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;She comes! Save
      me,&mdash;save me!&rdquo; and she fell at his feet in strong convulsions as the
      clock, falsely and in vain put forward, struck the half-hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician lifted her in his arms. &ldquo;My worst fears are confirmed,&rdquo; he
      said gravely; &ldquo;the disease is epilepsy.&rdquo; (The most celebrated practitioner
      in Dublin related to the editor a story of optical delusion precisely
      similar in its circumstances and its physical cause to the one here
      narrated.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The next night, at the same hour, Adela Glyndon died.

      &ldquo;Mourned!&mdash;and thou wert cruel enough to leave me gold; there it is,&mdash;there,
      untouched!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child of Nature! how, then, in this strange town of Marseilles, hast
      thou found bread and shelter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honestly, soul of my soul! honestly, but yet by the face thou didst once
      think so fair; thinkest thou THAT now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Fillide, more fair than ever. But what meanest thou?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a painter here&mdash;a great man, one of their great men at
      Paris, I know not what they call them; but he rules over all here,&mdash;life
      and death; and he has paid me largely but to sit for my portrait. It is
      for a picture to be given to the Nation, for he paints only for glory.
      Think of thy Fillide&rsquo;s renown!&rdquo; And the girl&rsquo;s wild eyes sparkled; her
      vanity was roused. &ldquo;And he would have married me if I would!&mdash;divorced
      his wife to marry me! But I waited for thee, ungrateful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A knock at the door was heard,&mdash;a man entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nicot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Glyndon!&mdash;hum!&mdash;welcome! What! thou art twice my rival! But
      Jean Nicot bears no malice. Virtue is my dream,&mdash;my country, my
      mistress. Serve my country, citizen; and I forgive thee the preference of
      beauty. Ca ira! ca ira!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But as the painter spoke, it hymned, it rolled through the streets,&mdash;the
      fiery song of the Marseillaise! There was a crowd, a multitude, a people
      up, abroad, with colours and arms, enthusiasm and song,&mdash;with song,
      with enthusiasm, with colours and arms! And who could guess that that
      martial movement was one, not of war, but massacre,&mdash;Frenchmen
      against Frenchmen? For there are two parties in Marseilles,&mdash;and
      ample work for Jourdan Coupe-tete! But this, the Englishman, just arrived,
      a stranger to all factions, did not as yet comprehend. He comprehended
      nothing but the song, the enthusiasm, the arms, and the colours that
      lifted to the sun the glorious lie, &ldquo;Le peuple Francais, debout contre les
      tyrans!&rdquo; (Up, Frenchmen, against tyrants!)
    </p>
    <p>
      The dark brow of the wretched wanderer grew animated; he gazed from the
      window on the throng that marched below, beneath their waving Oriflamme.
      They shouted as they beheld the patriot Nicot, the friend of Liberty and
      relentless Hebert, by the stranger&rsquo;s side, at the casement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, shout again!&rdquo; cried the painter,&mdash;&ldquo;shout for the brave
      Englishman who abjures his Pitts and his Coburgs to be a citizen of
      Liberty and France!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A thousand voices rent the air, and the hymn of the Marseillaise rose in
      majesty again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and if it be among these high hopes and this brave people that the
      phantom is to vanish, and the cure to come!&rdquo; muttered Glyndon; and he
      thought he felt again the elixir sparkling through his veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou shalt be one of the Convention with Paine and Clootz,&mdash;I will
      manage it all for thee!&rdquo; cried Nicot, slapping him on the shoulder: &ldquo;and
      Paris&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, if I could but see Paris!&rdquo; cried Fillide, in her joyous voice.
      Joyous! the whole time, the town, the air&mdash;save where, unheard, rose
      the cry of agony and the yell of murder&mdash;were joy! Sleep unhaunting
      in thy grave, cold Adela. Joy, joy! In the Jubilee of Humanity all private
      griefs should cease! Behold, wild mariner, the vast whirlpool draws thee
      to its stormy bosom! There the individual is not. All things are of the
      whole! Open thy gates, fair Paris, for the stranger-citizen! Receive in
      your ranks, O meek Republicans, the new champion of liberty, of reason, of
      mankind! &ldquo;Mejnour is right; it was in virtue, in valour, in glorious
      struggle for the human race, that the spectre was to shrink to her kindred
      darkness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Nicot&rsquo;s shrill voice praised him; and lean Robespierre&mdash;&ldquo;Flambeau,
      colonne, pierre angulaire de l&rsquo;edifice de la Republique!&rdquo; (&ldquo;The light,
      column, and keystone of the Republic.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Lettre du Citoyen P&mdash;;
      Papiers inedits trouves chez Robespierre,&rdquo; tom 11, page 127.)&mdash;smiled
      ominously on him from his bloodshot eyes; and Fillide clasped him with
      passionate arms to her tender breast. And at his up-rising and
      down-sitting, at board and in bed, though he saw it not, the Nameless One
      guided him with the demon eyes to the sea whose waves were gore.

     Therefore the Genii were painted with a platter full of garlands
     and flowers in one hand, and a whip in the other.&mdash;Alexander
     Ross, &ldquo;Mystag. Poet.&rdquo;
  </pre>
    <p>
      According to the order of the events related in this narrative, the
      departure of Zanoni and Viola from the Greek isle, in which two happy
      years appear to have been passed, must have been somewhat later in date
      than the arrival of Glyndon at Marseilles. It must have been in the course
      of the year 1791 when Viola fled from Naples with her mysterious lover,
      and when Glyndon sought Mejnour in the fatal castle. It is now towards the
      close of 1793, when our story again returns to Zanoni. The stars of winter
      shone down on the lagunes of Venice. The hum of the Rialto was hushed,&mdash;the
      last loiterers had deserted the Place of St. Mark&rsquo;s, and only at distant
      intervals might be heard the oars of the rapid gondolas, bearing reveller
      or lover to his home. But lights still flitted to and fro across the
      windows of one of the Palladian palaces, whose shadow slept in the great
      canal; and within the palace watched the twin Eumenides that never sleep
      for Man,&mdash;Fear and Pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will make thee the richest man in all Venice, if thou savest her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signor,&rdquo; said the leech; &ldquo;your gold cannot control death, and the will of
      Heaven, signor, unless within the next hour there is some blessed change,
      prepare your courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ho&mdash;ho, Zanoni! man of mystery and might, who hast walked amidst the
      passions of the world, with no changes on thy brow, art thou tossed at
      last upon the billows of tempestuous fear? Does thy spirit reel to and
      fro?&mdash;knowest thou at last the strength and the majesty of Death?
    </p>
    <p>
      He fled, trembling, from the pale-faced man of art,&mdash;fled through
      stately hall and long-drawn corridor, and gained a remote chamber in the
      palace, which other step than his was not permitted to profane. Out with
      thy herbs and vessels. Break from the enchanted elements, O silvery-azure
      flame! Why comes he not,&mdash;the Son of the Starbeam! Why is Adon-Ai
      deaf to thy solemn call? It comes not,&mdash;the luminous and delightsome
      Presence! Cabalist! are thy charms in vain? Has thy throne vanished from
      the realms of space? Thou standest pale and trembling. Pale trembler! not
      thus didst thou look when the things of glory gathered at thy spell. Never
      to the pale trembler bow the things of glory: the soul, and not the herbs,
      nor the silvery-azure flame, nor the spells of the Cabala, commands the
      children of the air; and THY soul, by Love and Death, is made sceptreless
      and discrowned!
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the flame quivers,&mdash;the air grows cold as the wind in
      charnels. A thing not of earth is present,&mdash;a mistlike, formless
      thing. It cowers in the distance,&mdash;a silent Horror! it rises; it
      creeps; it nears thee&mdash;dark in its mantle of dusky haze; and under
      its veil it looks on thee with its livid, malignant eyes,&mdash;the thing
      of malignant eyes!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, young Chaldean! young in thy countless ages,&mdash;young as when,
      cold to pleasure and to beauty, thou stoodest on the old Firetower, and
      heardest the starry silence whisper to thee the last mystery that baffles
      Death,&mdash;fearest thou Death at length? Is thy knowledge but a circle
      that brings thee back whence thy wanderings began! Generations on
      generations have withered since we two met! Lo! thou beholdest me now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I behold thee without fear! Though beneath thine eyes thousands have
      perished; though, where they burn, spring up the foul poisons of the human
      heart, and to those whom thou canst subject to thy will, thy presence
      glares in the dreams of the raving maniac, or blackens the dungeon of
      despairing crime, thou art not my vanquisher, but my slave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as a slave will I serve thee! Command thy slave, O beautiful
      Chaldean! Hark, the wail of women!&mdash;hark, the sharp shriek of thy
      beloved one! Death is in thy palace! Adon-Ai comes not to thy call. Only
      where no cloud of the passion and the flesh veils the eye of the Serene
      Intelligence can the Sons of the Starbeam glide to man. But <i>I</i> can
      aid thee!&mdash;hark!&rdquo; And Zanoni heard distinctly in his heart, even at
      that distance from the chamber, the voice of Viola calling in delirium on
      her beloved one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Viola, I can save thee not!&rdquo; exclaimed the seer, passionately; &ldquo;my
      love for thee has made me powerless!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not powerless; I can gift thee with the art to save her,&mdash;I can
      place healing in thy hand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For both?&mdash;child and mother,&mdash;for both?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A convulsion shook the limbs of the seer,&mdash;a mighty struggle shook
      him as a child: the Humanity and the Hour conquered the repugnant spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I yield! Mother and child&mdash;save both!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dark chamber lay Viola, in the sharpest agonies of travail; life
      seemed rending itself away in the groans and cries that spoke of pain in
      the midst of frenzy; and still, in groan and cry, she called on Zanoni,
      her beloved. The physician looked to the clock; on it beat: the Heart of
      Time,&mdash;regularly and slowly,&mdash;Heart that never sympathised with
      Life, and never flagged for Death! &ldquo;The cries are fainter,&rdquo; said the
      leech; &ldquo;in ten minutes more all will be past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fool! the minutes laugh at thee; Nature, even now, like a blue sky through
      a shattered temple, is smiling through the tortured frame. The breathing
      grows more calm and hushed; the voice of delirium is dumb,&mdash;a sweet
      dream has come to Viola. Is it a dream, or is it the soul that sees? She
      thinks suddenly that she is with Zanoni, that her burning head is pillowed
      on his bosom; she thinks, as he gazes on her, that his eyes dispel the
      tortures that prey upon her,&mdash;the touch of his hand cools the fever
      on her brow; she hears his voice in murmurs,&mdash;it is a music from
      which the fiends fly. Where is the mountain that seemed to press upon her
      temples? Like a vapour, it rolls away. In the frosts of the winter night,
      she sees the sun laughing in luxurious heaven,&mdash;she hears the whisper
      of green leaves; the beautiful world, valley and stream and woodland, lie
      before, and with a common voice speak to her, &ldquo;We are not yet past for
      thee!&rdquo; Fool of drugs and formula, look to thy dial-plate!&mdash;the hand
      has moved on; the minutes are with Eternity; the soul thy sentence would
      have dismissed, still dwells on the shores of Time. She sleeps: the fever
      abates; the convulsions are gone; the living rose blooms upon her cheek;
      the crisis is past! Husband, thy wife lives; lover, thy universe is no
      solitude! Heart of Time, beat on! A while, a little while,&mdash;joy! joy!
      joy!&mdash;father, embrace thy child!

    <p>
      And they placed the child in the father&rsquo;s arms! As silently he bent over
      it, tears&mdash;tears, how human!&mdash;fell from his eyes like rain! And
      the little one smiled through the tears that bathed its cheeks! Ah, with

      what agonising tears we dismiss the stranger back to the angels! Unselfish
      joy; but how selfish is the sorrow!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now through the silent chamber a faint sweet voice is heard,&mdash;the
      young mother&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here: I am by thy side!&rdquo; murmured Zanoni.

      The mother smiled, and clasped his hand, and asked no more; she was
      contented.
    </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      Viola recovered with a rapidity that startled the physician; and the young
      stranger thrived as if it already loved the world to which it had
      descended. From that hour Zanoni seemed to live in the infant&rsquo;s life, and
      in that life the souls of mother and father met as in a new bond. Nothing
      more beautiful than this infant had eye ever dwelt upon. It was strange to
      the nurses that it came not wailing to the light, but smiled to the light
      as a thing familiar to it before. It never uttered one cry of childish
      pain. In its very repose it seemed to be listening to some happy voice
      within its heart: it seemed itself so happy. In its eyes you would have
      thought intellect already kindled, though it had not yet found a language.
      Already it seemed to recognise its parents; already it stretched forth its
      arms when Zanoni bent over the bed, in which it breathed and bloomed,&mdash;the
      budding flower! And from that bed he was rarely absent: gazing upon it
      with his serene, delighted eyes, his soul seemed to feed its own. At night
      and in utter darkness he was still there; and Viola often heard him
      murmuring over it as she lay in a half-sleep. But the murmur was in a
      language strange to her; and sometimes when she heard she feared, and
      vague, undefined superstitions came back to her,&mdash;the superstitions
      of earlier youth. A mother fears everything, even the gods, for her
      new-born. The mortals shrieked aloud when of old they saw the great
      Demeter seeking to make their child immortal.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Zanoni, wrapped in the sublime designs that animated the human love to
      which he was now awakened, forgot all, even all he had forfeited or
      incurred, in the love that blinded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the dark, formless thing, though he nor invoked nor saw it, crept,
      often, round and round him, and often sat by the infant&rsquo;s couch, with its
      hateful eyes.

     (Embraces the Earth with gloomy wings.)
</pre>
    <p>
      Letter from Zanoni to Mejnour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mejnour, Humanity, with all its sorrows and its joys, is mine once more.
      Day by day, I am forging my own fetters. I live in other lives than my
      own, and in them I have lost more than half my empire. Not lifting them
      aloft, they drag me by the strong bands of the affections to their own
      earth. Exiled from the beings only visible to the most abstract sense, the
      grim Enemy that guards the Threshold has entangled me in its web. Canst
      thou credit me, when I tell thee that I have accepted its gifts, and
      endure the forfeit? Ages must pass ere the brighter beings can again obey
      the spirit that has bowed to the ghastly one! And&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      In this hope, then, Mejnour, I triumph still; I yet have supreme power
      over this young life. Insensibly and inaudibly my soul speaks to its own,
      and prepares it even now. Thou knowest that for the pure and unsullied
      infant spirit, the ordeal has no terror and no peril. Thus unceasingly I
      nourish it with no unholy light; and ere it yet be conscious of the gift,
      it will gain the privileges it has been mine to attain: the child, by slow
      and scarce-seen degrees, will communicate its own attributes to the
      mother; and content to see Youth forever radiant on the brows of the two
      that now suffice to fill up my whole infinity of thought, shall I regret
      the airier kingdom that vanishes hourly from my grasp? But thou, whose
      vision is still clear and serene, look into the far deeps shut from my
      gaze, and counsel me, or forewarn! I know that the gifts of the Being
      whose race is so hostile to our own are, to the common seeker, fatal and
      perfidious as itself. And hence, when, at the outskirts of knowledge,
      which in earlier ages men called Magic, they encountered the things of the
      hostile tribes, they believed the apparitions to be fiends, and, by
      fancied compacts, imagined they had signed away their souls; as if man
      could give for an eternity that over which he has control but while he
      lives! Dark, and shrouded forever from human sight, dwell the demon
      rebels, in their impenetrable realm; in them is no breath of the Divine
      One. In every human creature the Divine One breathes; and He alone can
      judge His own hereafter, and allot its new career and home. Could man sell
      himself to the fiend, man could prejudge himself, and arrogate the
      disposal of eternity! But these creatures, modifications as they are of
      matter, and some with more than the malignanty of man, may well seem, to
      fear and unreasoning superstition, the representatives of fiends. And from
      the darkest and mightiest of them I have accepted a boon,&mdash;the secret
      that startled Death from those so dear to me. Can I not trust that enough
      of power yet remains to me to baffle or to daunt the Phantom, if it seek
      to pervert the gift? Answer me, Mejnour, for in the darkness that veils
      me, I see only the pure eyes of the new-born; I hear only the low beating
      of my heart. Answer me, thou whose wisdom is without love!
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Fallen One!&mdash;I see before thee Evil and Death and Woe! Thou to have
      relinquished Adon-Ai for the nameless Terror,&mdash;the heavenly stars for
      those fearful eyes! Thou, at the last to be the victim of the Larva of the
      dreary Threshold, that, in thy first novitiate, fled, withered and
      shrivelled, from thy kingly brow! When, at the primary grades of
      initiation, the pupil I took from thee on the shores of the changed
      Parthenope, fell senseless and cowering before that Phantom-Darkness, I
      knew that his spirit was not formed to front the worlds beyond; for FEAR
      is the attraction of man to earthiest earth, and while he fears, he cannot
      soar. But THOU, seest thou not that to love is but to fear; seest thou not
      that the power of which thou boastest over the malignant one is already
      gone? It awes, it masters thee; it will mock thee and betray. Lose not a
      moment; come to me. If there can yet be sufficient sympathy between us,
      through MY eyes shalt thou see, and perhaps guard against the perils that,
      shapeless yet, and looming through the shadow, marshal themselves around
      thee and those whom thy very love has doomed. Come from all the ties of
      thy fond humanity; they will but obscure thy vision! Come forth from thy
      fears and hopes, thy desires and passions. Come, as alone Mind can be the
      monarch and the seer, shining through the home it tenants,&mdash;a pure,
      impressionless, sublime intelligence!

      days;&rdquo; and he went so suddenly that there was little time either for
      surprise or sorrow. But first parting is always more melancholy than it
      need be: it seems an interruption to the existence which Love shares with
      Love; it makes the heart feel what a void life will be when the last
      parting shall succeed, as succeed it must, the first. But Viola had a new
      companion; she was enjoying that most delicious novelty which ever renews
      the youth and dazzles the eyes of woman. As the mistress&mdash;the wife&mdash;she
      leans on another; from another are reflected her happiness, her being,&mdash;as
      an orb that takes light from its sun. But now, in turn, as the mother, she
      is raised from dependence into power; it is another that leans on her,&mdash;a
      star has sprung into space, to which she herself has become the sun!
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days,&mdash;but they will be sweet through the sorrow! A few days,&mdash;every
      hour of which seems an era to the infant, over whom bend watchful the eyes
      and the heart. From its waking to its sleep, from its sleep to its waking,
      is a revolution in Time. Every gesture to be noted,&mdash;every smile to
      seem a new progress into the world it has come to bless! Zanoni has gone,&mdash;the
      last dash of the oar is lost, the last speck of the gondola has vanished
      from the ocean-streets of Venice! Her infant is sleeping in the cradle at
      the mother&rsquo;s feet; and she thinks through her tears what tales of the
      fairy-land, that spreads far and wide, with a thousand wonders, in that
      narrow bed, she shall have to tell the father! Smile on, weep on, young
      mother! Already the fairest leaf in the wild volume is closed for thee,
      and the invisible finger turns the page!
    </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      By the bridge of the Rialto stood two Venetians&mdash;ardent Republicans
      and Democrats&mdash;looking to the Revolution of France as the earthquake
      which must shatter their own expiring and vicious constitution, and give
      equality of ranks and rights to Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Cottalto,&rdquo; said one; &ldquo;my correspondent of Paris has promised to
      elude all obstacles, and baffle all danger. He will arrange with us the
      hour of revolt, when the legions of France shall be within hearing of our
      guns. One day in this week, at this hour, he is to meet me here. This is
      but the fourth day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had scarce said these words before a man, wrapped in his roquelaire,
      emerging from one of the narrow streets to the left, halted opposite the
      pair, and eying them for a few moments with an earnest scrutiny,
      whispered, &ldquo;Salut!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Et fraternite,&rdquo; answered the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, then, are the brave Dandolo with whom the Comite deputed me to
      correspond? And this citizen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Cottalto, whom my letters have so often mentioned.&rdquo; (I know not if the
      author of the original MSS. designs, under these names, to introduce the
      real Cottalto and the true Dandolo, who, in 1797, distinguished themselves
      by their sympathy with the French, and their democratic ardor.&mdash;Ed.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Health and brotherhood to him! I have much to impart to you both. I will
      meet you at night, Dandolo. But in the streets we may be observed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I dare not appoint my own house; tyranny makes spies of our very
      walls. But the place herein designated is secure;&rdquo; and he slipped an
      address into the hand of his correspondent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night, then, at nine! Meanwhile I have other business.&rdquo; The man
      paused, his colour changed, and it was with an eager and passionate voice
      that he resumed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your last letter mentioned this wealthy and mysterious visitor,&mdash;this
      Zanoni. He is still at Venice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard that he had left this morning; but his wife is still here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His wife!&mdash;that is well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What know you of him? Think you that he would join us? His wealth would
      be&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His house, his address,&mdash;quick!&rdquo; interrupted the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Palazzo di &mdash;, on the Grand Canal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you,&mdash;at nine we meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man hurried on through the street from which he had emerged; and,
      passing by the house in which he had taken up his lodging (he had arrived
      at Venice the night before), a woman who stood by the door caught his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she said in French, &ldquo;I have been watching for your return. Do
      you understand me? I will brave all, risk all, to go back with you to
      France,&mdash;to stand, through life or in death, by my husband&rsquo;s side!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Citoyenne, I promised your husband that, if such your choice, I would
      hazard my own safety to aid it. But think again! Your husband is one of
      the faction which Robespierre&rsquo;s eyes have already marked; he cannot fly.
      All France is become a prison to the &lsquo;suspect.&rsquo; You do not endanger
      yourself by return. Frankly, citoyenne, the fate you would share may be
      the guillotine. I speak (as you know by his letter) as your husband bade
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, I will return with you,&rdquo; said the woman, with a smile upon her
      pale face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you deserted your husband in the fair sunshine of the Revolution,
      to return to him amidst its storms and thunder,&rdquo; said the man, in a tone
      half of wonder, half rebuke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because my father&rsquo;s days were doomed; because he had no safety but in
      flight to a foreign land; because he was old and penniless, and had none
      but me to work for him; because my husband was not then in danger, and my
      father was! HE is dead&mdash;dead! My husband is in danger now. The
      daughter&rsquo;s duties are no more,&mdash;the wife&rsquo;s return!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so, citoyenne; on the third night I depart. Before then you may
      retract your choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A dark smile passed over the man&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O guillotine!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how many virtues hast thou brought to light!
      Well may they call thee &lsquo;A Holy Mother!&rsquo; O gory guillotine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He passed on muttering to himself, hailed a gondola, and was soon amidst
      the crowded waters of the Grand Canal.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Ce que j&rsquo;ignore
     Est plus triste peut-etre et plus affreux encore.
     La Harpe, &ldquo;Le Comte de Warwick,&rdquo; Act 5, sc. 1.

     (That which I know not is, perhaps, more sad and fearful still.)
</pre>
    <p>
      The casement stood open, and Viola was seated by it. Beneath sparkled the
      broad waters in the cold but cloudless sunlight; and to that fair form,
      that half-averted face, turned the eyes of many a gallant cavalier, as
      their gondolas glided by.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at last, in the centre of the canal, one of these dark vessels halted
      motionless, as a man fixed his gaze from its lattice upon that stately
      palace. He gave the word to the rowers,&mdash;the vessel approached the
      marge. The stranger quitted the gondola; he passed up the broad stairs; he
      entered the palace. Weep on, smile no more, young mother!&mdash;the last
      page is turned!
    </p>
    <p>
      An attendant entered the room, and gave to Viola a card, with these words
      in English, &ldquo;Viola, I must see you! Clarence Glyndon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, yes, how gladly Viola would see him; how gladly speak to him of her
      happiness, of Zanoni!&mdash;how gladly show to him her child! Poor
      Clarence! she had forgotten him till now, as she had all the fever of her
      earlier life,&mdash;its dreams, its vanities, its poor excitement, the
      lamps of the gaudy theatre, the applause of the noisy crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered. She started to behold him, so changed were his gloomy brow,
      his resolute, careworn features, from the graceful form and careless
      countenance of the artist-lover. His dress, though not mean, was rude,
      neglected, and disordered. A wild, desperate, half-savage air had
      supplanted that ingenuous mien, diffident in its grace, earnest in its
      diffidence, which had once characterised the young worshipper of Art, the
      dreaming aspirant after some starrier lore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you?&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;Poor Clarence, how changed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Changed!&rdquo; he said abruptly, as he placed himself by her side. &ldquo;And whom
      am I to thank, but the fiends&mdash;the sorcerers&mdash;who have seized
      upon thy existence, as upon mine? Viola, hear me. A few weeks since the
      news reached me that you were in Venice. Under other pretences, and
      through innumerable dangers, I have come hither, risking liberty, perhaps
      life, if my name and career are known in Venice, to warn and save you.
      Changed, you call me!&mdash;changed without; but what is that to the
      ravages within? Be warned, be warned in time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Glyndon, sounding hollow and sepulchral, alarmed Viola even
      more than his words. Pale, haggard, emaciated, he seemed almost as one
      risen from the dead, to appall and awe her. &ldquo;What,&rdquo; she said, at last, in
      a faltering voice,&mdash;&ldquo;what wild words do you utter! Can you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; interrupted Glyndon, laying his hand upon her arm, and its touch
      was as cold as death,&mdash;&ldquo;listen! You have heard of the old stories of
      men who have leagued themselves with devils for the attainment of
      preternatural powers. Those stories are not fables. Such men live. Their
      delight is to increase the unhallowed circle of wretches like themselves.
      If their proselytes fail in the ordeal, the demon seizes them, even in
      this life, as it hath seized me!&mdash;if they succeed, woe, yea, a more
      lasting woe! There is another life, where no spells can charm the evil
      one, or allay the torture. I have come from a scene where blood flows in
      rivers,&mdash;where Death stands by the side of the bravest and the
      highest, and the one monarch is the Guillotine; but all the mortal perils
      with which men can be beset, are nothing to the dreariness of the chamber
      where the Horror that passes death moves and stirs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was then that Glyndon, with a cold and distinct precision, detailed, as
      he had done to Adela, the initiation through which he had gone. He
      described, in words that froze the blood of his listener, the appearance
      of that formless phantom, with the eyes that seared the brain and
      congealed the marrow of those who beheld. Once seen, it never was to be
      exorcised. It came at its own will, prompting black thoughts,&mdash;whispering
      strange temptations. Only in scenes of turbulent excitement was it absent!
      Solitude, serenity, the struggling desires after peace and virtue,&mdash;THESE
      were the elements it loved to haunt! Bewildered, terror-stricken, the wild
      account confirmed by the dim impressions that never, in the depth and
      confidence of affection, had been closely examined, but rather banished as
      soon as felt,&mdash;that the life and attributes of Zanoni were not like
      those of mortals,&mdash;impressions which her own love had made her
      hitherto censure as suspicions that wronged, and which, thus mitigated,
      had perhaps only served to rivet the fascinated chains in which he bound
      her heart and senses, but which now, as Glyndon&rsquo;s awful narrative filled
      her with contagious dread, half unbound the very spells they had woven
      before,&mdash;Viola started up in fear, not for HERSELF, and clasped her
      child in her arms!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappiest one!&rdquo; cried Glyndon, shuddering, &ldquo;hast thou indeed given birth
      to a victim thou canst not save? Refuse it sustenance,&mdash;let it look
      to thee in vain for food! In the grave, at least, there are repose and
      peace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there came back to Viola&rsquo;s mind the remembrance of Zanoni&rsquo;s
      night-long watches by that cradle, and the fear which even then had crept
      over her as she heard his murmured half-chanted words. And as the child
      looked at her with its clear, steadfast eye, in the strange intelligence
      of that look there was something that only confirmed her awe. So there
      both Mother and Forewarner stood in silence,&mdash;the sun smiling upon
      them through the casement, and dark by the cradle, though they saw it not,
      sat the motionless, veiled Thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      But by degrees better and juster and more grateful memories of the past
      returned to the young mother. The features of the infant, as she gazed,
      took the aspect of the absent father. A voice seemed to break from those
      rosy lips, and say, mournfully, &ldquo;I speak to thee in thy child. In return
      for all my love for thee and thine, dost thou distrust me, at the first
      sentence of a maniac who accuses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her breast heaved, her stature rose, her eyes shone with a serene and holy
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, poor victim of thine own delusions,&rdquo; she said to Glyndon; &ldquo;I would
      not believe mine own senses, if they accused ITS father! And what knowest
      thou of Zanoni? What relation have Mejnour and the grisly spectres he
      invoked, with the radiant image with which thou wouldst connect them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou wilt learn too soon,&rdquo; replied Glyndon, gloomily. &ldquo;And the very
      phantom that haunts me, whispers, with its bloodless lips, that its
      horrors await both thine and thee! I take not thy decision yet; before I
      leave Venice we shall meet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said, and departed.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Quel est l&rsquo;egarement ou ton ame se livre?
     La Harpe, &ldquo;Le Comte de Warwick,&rdquo; Act 4, sc. 4.

     (To what delusion does thy soul abandon itself?)
</pre>
    <p>
      Alas, Zanoni! the aspirer, the dark, bright one!&mdash;didst thou think
      that the bond between the survivor of ages and the daughter of a day could
      endure? Didst thou not foresee that, until the ordeal was past, there
      could be no equality between thy wisdom and her love? Art thou absent now
      seeking amidst thy solemn secrets the solemn safeguards for child and
      mother, and forgettest thou that the phantom that served thee hath power
      over its own gifts,&mdash;over the lives it taught thee to rescue from the
      grave? Dost thou not know that Fear and Distrust, once sown in the heart
      of Love, spring up from the seed into a forest that excludes the stars?
      Dark, bright one! the hateful eyes glare beside the mother and the child!
    </p>
    <p>
      All that day Viola was distracted by a thousand thoughts and terrors,
      which fled as she examined them to settle back the darklier. She
      remembered that, as she had once said to Glyndon, her very childhood had
      been haunted with strange forebodings, that she was ordained for some
      preternatural doom. She remembered that, as she had told him this, sitting
      by the seas that slumbered in the arms of the Bay of Naples, he, too, had
      acknowledged the same forebodings, and a mysterious sympathy had appeared
      to unite their fates. She remembered, above all, that, comparing their
      entangled thoughts, both had then said, that with the first sight of
      Zanoni the foreboding, the instinct, had spoken to their hearts more
      audibly than before, whispering that &ldquo;with HIM was connected the secret of
      the unconjectured life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now, when Glyndon and Viola met again, the haunting fears of
      childhood, thus referred to, woke from their enchanted sleep. With
      Glyndon&rsquo;s terror she felt a sympathy, against which her reason and her
      love struggled in vain. And still, when she turned her looks upon her
      child, it watched her with that steady, earnest eye, and its lips moved as
      if it sought to speak to her,&mdash;but no sound came. The infant refused
      to sleep. Whenever she gazed upon its face, still those wakeful, watchful
      eyes!&mdash;and in their earnestness, there spoke something of pain, of
      upbraiding, of accusation. They chilled her as she looked. Unable to
      endure, of herself, this sudden and complete revulsion of all the feelings
      which had hitherto made up her life, she formed the resolution natural to
      her land and creed; she sent for the priest who had habitually attended
      her at Venice, and to him she confessed, with passionate sobs and intense
      terror, the doubts that had broken upon her. The good father, a worthy and
      pious man, but with little education and less sense, one who held (as many
      of the lower Italians do to this day) even a poet to be a sort of
      sorcerer, seemed to shut the gates of hope upon her heart. His
      remonstrances were urgent, for his horror was unfeigned. He joined with
      Glyndon in imploring her to fly, if she felt the smallest doubt that her
      husband&rsquo;s pursuits were of the nature which the Roman Church had
      benevolently burned so many scholars for adopting. And even the little
      that Viola could communicate seemed, to the ignorant ascetic, irrefragable
      proof of sorcery and witchcraft; he had, indeed, previously heard some of
      the strange rumours which followed the path of Zanoni, and was therefore
      prepared to believe the worst; the worthy Bartolomeo would have made no
      bones of sending Watt to the stake, had he heard him speak of the
      steam-engine. But Viola, as untutored as himself, was terrified by his
      rough and vehement eloquence,&mdash;terrified, for by that penetration
      which Catholic priests, however dull, generally acquire, in their vast
      experience of the human heart hourly exposed to their probe, Bartolomeo
      spoke less of danger to herself than to her child. &ldquo;Sorcerers,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;have ever sought the most to decoy and seduce the souls of the young,&mdash;nay,
      the infant;&rdquo; and therewith he entered into a long catalogue of legendary
      fables, which he quoted as historical facts. All at which an English woman
      would have smiled, appalled the tender but superstitious Neapolitan; and
      when the priest left her, with solemn rebukes and grave accusations of a
      dereliction of her duties to her child, if she hesitated to fly with it
      from an abode polluted by the darker powers and unhallowed arts, Viola,
      still clinging to the image of Zanoni, sank into a passive lethargy which
      held her very reason in suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours passed: night came on; the house was hushed; and Viola, slowly
      awakened from the numbness and torpor which had usurped her faculties,
      tossed to and fro on her couch, restless and perturbed. The stillness
      became intolerable; yet more intolerable the sound that alone broke it,
      the voice of the clock, knelling moment after moment to its grave. The
      moments, at last, seemed themselves to find voice,&mdash;to gain shape.
      She thought she beheld them springing, wan and fairy-like, from the womb
      of darkness; and ere they fell again, extinguished, into that womb, their
      grave, their low small voices murmured, &ldquo;Woman, we report to eternity all
      that is done in time! What shall we report of thee, O guardian of a
      new-born soul?&rdquo; She became sensible that her fancies had brought a sort of
      partial delirium, that she was in a state between sleep and waking, when
      suddenly one thought became more predominant than the rest. The chamber
      which, in that and every house they had inhabited, even that in the Greek
      isles, Zanoni had set apart to a solitude on which none might intrude, the
      threshold of which even Viola&rsquo;s step was forbid to cross, and never,
      hitherto, in that sweet repose of confidence which belongs to contented
      love, had she even felt the curious desire to disobey,&mdash;now, that
      chamber drew her towards it. Perhaps THERE might be found a somewhat to
      solve the riddle, to dispel or confirm the doubt: that thought grew and
      deepened in its intenseness; it fastened on her as with a palpable and
      irresistible grasp; it seemed to raise her limbs without her will.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, through the chamber, along the galleries thou glidest, O lovely
      shape! sleep-walking, yet awake. The moon shines on thee as thou glidest
      by, casement after casement, white-robed and wandering spirit!&mdash;thine
      arms crossed upon thy bosom, thine eyes fixed and open, with a calm
      unfearing awe. Mother, it is thy child that leads thee on! The fairy
      moments go before thee; thou hearest still the clock-knell tolling them to
      their graves behind. On, gliding on, thou hast gained the door; no lock
      bars thee, no magic spell drives thee back. Daughter of the dust, thou
      standest alone with night in the chamber where, pale and numberless, the
      hosts of space have gathered round the seer!

      She stood within the chamber, and gazed around her; no signs by which an
      inquisitor of old could have detected the scholar of the Black Art were
      visible. No crucibles and caldrons, no brass-bound volumes and ciphered
      girdles, no skulls and cross-bones. Quietly streamed the broad moonlight
      through the desolate chamber with its bare, white walls. A few bunches of
      withered herbs, a few antique vessels of bronze, placed carelessly on a
      wooden form, were all which that curious gaze could identify with the
      pursuits of the absent owner. The magic, if it existed, dwelt in the
      artificer, and the materials, to other hands, were but herbs and bronze.
      So is it ever with thy works and wonders, O Genius,&mdash;Seeker of the
      Stars! Words themselves are the common property of all men; yet, from
      words themselves, Thou Architect of Immortalities, pilest up temples that
      shall outlive the Pyramids, and the very leaf of the Papyrus becomes a
      Shinar, stately with towers, round which the Deluge of Ages, shall roar in
      vain!
    </p>
    <p>
      But in that solitude has the Presence that there had invoked its wonders
      left no enchantment of its own? It seemed so; for as Viola stood in the
      chamber, she became sensible that some mysterious change was at work
      within herself. Her blood coursed rapidly, and with a sensation of
      delight, through her veins,&mdash;she felt as if chains were falling from
      her limbs, as if cloud after cloud was rolling from her gaze. All the
      confused thoughts which had moved through her trance settled and centred
      themselves in one intense desire to see the Absent One,&mdash;to be with
      him. The monads that make up space and air seemed charged with a spiritual
      attraction,&mdash;to become a medium through which her spirit could pass
      from its clay, and confer with the spirit to which the unutterable desire
      compelled it. A faintness seized her; she tottered to the seat on which
      the vessels and herbs were placed, and, as she bent down, she saw in one
      of the vessels a small vase of crystal. By a mechanical and involuntary
      impulse, her hand seized the vase; she opened it, and the volatile essence
      it contained sparkled up, and spread through the room a powerful and
      delicious fragrance. She inhaled the odour, she laved her temples with the
      liquid, and suddenly her life seemed to spring up from the previous
      faintness,&mdash;to spring, to soar, to float, to dilate upon the wings of
      a bird. The room vanished from her eyes. Away, away, over lands and seas
      and space on the rushing desire flies the disprisoned mind!
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon a stratum, not of this world, stood the world-born shapes of the sons
      of Science, upon an embryo world, upon a crude, wan, attenuated mass of
      matter, one of the Nebulae, which the suns of the myriad systems throw off
      as they roll round the Creator&rsquo;s throne*, to become themselves new worlds
      of symmetry and glory,&mdash;planets and suns that forever and forever
      shall in their turn multiply their shining race, and be the fathers of
      suns and planets yet to come.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*"Astronomy instructs us that, in the original condition of
     the solar system, the sun was the nucleus of a nebulosity or
     luminous mass which revolved on its axis, and extended far
     beyond the orbits of all the planets,&mdash;the planets as yet
     having no existence. Its temperature gradually diminished,
     and, becoming contracted by cooling, the rotation increased
     in rapidity, and zones of nebulosity were successively
     thrown off, in consequence of the centrifugal force
     overpowering the central attraction. The condensation of
     these separate masses constituted the planets and
     satellites. But this view of the conversion of gaseous
     matter into planetary bodies is not limited to our own
     system; it extends to the formation of the innumerable suns
     and worlds which are distributed throughout the universe.
     The sublime discoveries of modern astronomers have shown
     that every part of the realms of space abounds in large
     expansions of attenuated matter termed nebulae, which are
     irregularly reflective of light, of various figures, and in
     different states of condensation, from that of a diffused,
     luminous mass to suns and planets like our own.&rdquo;&mdash;From
     Mantell&rsquo;s eloquent and delightful work, entitled &ldquo;The
     Wonders of Geology,&rdquo; volume i. page 22.)
</pre>
    <p>
      There, in that enormous solitude of an infant world, which thousands and
      thousands of years can alone ripen into form, the spirit of Viola beheld
      the shape of Zanoni, or rather the likeness, the simulacrun, the LEMUR of
      his shape, not its human and corporeal substance,&mdash;as if, like hers,
      the Intelligence was parted from the Clay,&mdash;and as the sun, while it
      revolves and glows, had cast off into remotest space that nebular image of
      itself, so the thing of earth, in the action of its more luminous and
      enduring being, had thrown its likeness into that new-born stranger of the
      heavens. There stood the phantom,&mdash;a phantom Mejnour, by its side. In
      the gigantic chaos around raved and struggled the kindling elements; water
      and fire, darkness and light, at war,&mdash;vapour and cloud hardening
      into mountains, and the Breath of Life moving like a steadfast splendour
      over all.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the dreamer looked, and shivered, she beheld that even there the two
      phantoms of humanity were not alone. Dim monster-forms that that
      disordered chaos alone could engender, the first reptile Colossal race
      that wreathe and crawl through the earliest stratum of a world labouring
      into life, coiled in the oozing matter or hovered through the meteorous
      vapours. But these the two seekers seemed not to heed; their gaze was
      fixed intent upon an object in the farthest space. With the eyes of the
      spirit, Viola followed theirs; with a terror far greater than the chaos
      and its hideous inhabitants produced, she beheld a shadowy likeness of the
      very room in which her form yet dwelt, its white walls, the moonshine
      sleeping on its floor, its open casement, with the quiet roofs and domes
      of Venice looming over the sea that sighed below,&mdash;and in that room
      the ghost-like image of herself! This double phantom&mdash;here herself a
      phantom, gazing there upon a phantom-self&mdash;had in it a horror which
      no words can tell, no length of life forego.
    </p>
    <p>
      But presently she saw this image of herself rise slowly, leave the room
      with its noiseless feet: it passes the corridor, it kneels by a cradle!
      Heaven of Heaven! She beholds her child!&mdash;still with its wondrous,
      child-like beauty and its silent, wakeful eyes. But beside that cradle
      there sits cowering a mantled, shadowy form,&mdash;the more fearful and
      ghastly from its indistinct and unsubstantial gloom. The walls of that
      chamber seem to open as the scene of a theatre. A grim dungeon; streets
      through which pour shadowy crowds; wrath and hatred, and the aspect of
      demons in their ghastly visages; a place of death; a murderous instrument;
      a shamble-house of human flesh; herself; her child;&mdash;all, all, rapid
      phantasmagoria, chased each other. Suddenly the phantom-Zanoni turned, it
      seemed to perceive herself,&mdash;her second self. It sprang towards her;
      her spirit could bear no more. She shrieked, she woke. She found that in
      truth she had left that dismal chamber; the cradle was before her, the
      child! all&mdash;all as that trance had seen it; and, vanishing into air,
      even that dark, formless Thing!

      Letter from Viola to Zanoni.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has come to this!&mdash;I am the first to part! I, the unfaithful one,
      bid thee farewell forever. When thine eyes fall upon this writing thou
      wilt know me as one of the dead. For thou that wert, and still art my
      life,&mdash;I am lost to thee! O lover! O husband! O still worshipped and
      adored! if thou hast ever loved me, if thou canst still pity, seek not to
      discover the steps that fly thee. If thy charms can detect and tract me,
      spare me, spare our child! Zanoni, I will rear it to love thee, to call
      thee father! Zanoni, its young lips shall pray for thee! Ah, spare thy
      child, for infants are the saints of earth, and their mediation may be
      heard on high! Shall I tell thee why I part? No; thou, the
      wisely-terrible, canst divine what the hand trembles to record; and while
      I shudder at thy power,&mdash;while it is thy power I fly (our child upon
      my bosom),&mdash;it comforts me still to think that thy power can read the
      heart! Thou knowest that it is the faithful mother that writes to thee, it
      is not the faithless wife! Is there sin in thy knowledge, Zanoni? Sin must
      have sorrow: and it were sweet&mdash;oh, how sweet&mdash;to be thy
      comforter. But the child, the infant, the soul that looks to mine for its
      shield!&mdash;magician, I wrest from thee that soul! Pardon, pardon, if my
      words wrong thee. See, I fall on my knees to write the rest!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did I never recoil before from thy mysterious lore; why did the very
      strangeness of thine unearthly life only fascinate me with a delightful
      fear? Because, if thou wert sorcerer or angel-demon, there was no peril to
      other but myself: and none to me, for my love was my heavenliest part; and
      my ignorance in all things, except the art to love thee, repelled every
      thought that was not bright and glorious as thine image to my eyes. But
      NOW there is another! Look! why does it watch me thus,&mdash;why that
      never-sleeping, earnest, rebuking gaze? Have thy spells encompassed it
      already? Hast thou marked it, cruel one, for the terrors of thy
      unutterable art? Do not madden me,&mdash;do not madden me!&mdash;unbind
      the spell!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark! the oars without! They come,&mdash;they come, to bear me from thee!
      I look round, and methinks that I see thee everywhere. Thou speakest to me
      from every shadow, from every star. There, by the casement, thy lips last
      pressed mine; there, there by that threshold didst thou turn again, and
      thy smile seemed so trustingly to confide in me! Zanoni&mdash;husband!&mdash;I
      will stay! I cannot part from thee! No, no! I will go to the room where
      thy dear voice, with its gentle music, assuaged the pangs of travail!&mdash;where,
      heard through the thrilling darkness, it first whispered to my ear,
      &lsquo;Viola, thou art a mother!&rsquo; A mother!&mdash;yes, I rise from my knees,&mdash;I
      AM a mother! They come! I am firm; farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes; thus suddenly, thus cruelly, whether in the delirium of blind and
      unreasoning superstition, or in the resolve of that conviction which
      springs from duty, the being for whom he had resigned so much of empire
      and of glory forsook Zanoni. This desertion, never foreseen, never
      anticipated, was yet but the constant fate that attends those who would
      place Mind BEYOND the earth, and yet treasure the Heart WITHIN it.
      Ignorance everlastingly shall recoil from knowledge. But never yet, from
      nobler and purer motives of self-sacrifice, did human love link itself to
      another, than did the forsaking wife now abandon the absent. For rightly
      had she said that it was not the faithless wife, it WAS the faithful
      mother that fled from all in which her earthly happiness was centred.
    </p>
    <p>
      As long as the passion and fervour that impelled the act animated her with
      false fever, she clasped her infant to her breast, and was consoled,&mdash;resigned.
      But what bitter doubt of her own conduct, what icy pang of remorse shot
      through her heart, when, as they rested for a few hours on the road to
      Leghorn, she heard the woman who accompanied herself and Glyndon pray for
      safety to reach her husband&rsquo;s side, and strength to share the perils that
      would meet her there! Terrible contrast to her own desertion! She shrunk
      into the darkness of her own heart,&mdash;and then no voice from within
      consoled her.

      gush of a channel to Elysium. How burst into blossoming hopes fair hearts
      that had nourished themselves on the diamond dews of the rosy dawn, when
      Liberty came from the dark ocean, and the arms of decrepit Thraldom&mdash;Aurora
      from the bed of Tithon! Hopes! ye have ripened into fruit, and the fruit

      It is the Reign of Terror, with Robespierre the king. The struggles
      between the boa and the lion are past: the boa has consumed the lion, and
      is heavy with the gorge,&mdash;Danton has fallen, and Camille Desmoulins.
      Danton had said before his death, &ldquo;The poltroon Robespierre,&mdash;I alone
      could have saved him.&rdquo; From that hour, indeed, the blood of the dead giant
      clouded the craft of &ldquo;Maximilien the Incorruptible,&rdquo; as at last, amidst
      the din of the roused Convention, it choked his voice. (&ldquo;Le sang de Danton
      t&rsquo;etouffe!&rdquo; (the blood of Danton chokes thee!) said Garnier de l&rsquo;Aube,
      when on the fatal 9th of Thermidor, Robespierre gasped feebly forth, &ldquo;Pour
      la derniere fois, President des Assassins, je te demande la parole.&rdquo; (For
      the last time, President of Assassins, I demand to speak.)) If, after that
      last sacrifice, essential, perhaps, to his safety, Robespierre had
      proclaimed the close of the Reign of Terror, and acted upon the mercy
      which Danton had begun to preach, he might have lived and died a monarch.
      But the prisons continued to reek,&mdash;the glaive to fall; and
      Robespierre perceived not that his mobs were glutted to satiety with
      death, and the strongest excitement a chief could give would be a return
      from devils into men.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are transported to a room in the house of Citizen Dupleix, the
      menuisier, in the month of July, 1794; or, in the calendar of the
      Revolutionists, it was the Thermidor of the Second Year of the Republic,
      One and Indivisible! Though the room was small, it was furnished and
      decorated with a minute and careful effort at elegance and refinement. It
      seemed, indeed, the desire of the owner to avoid at once what was mean and
      rude, and what was luxurious and voluptuous. It was a trim, orderly,
      precise grace that shaped the classic chairs, arranged the ample
      draperies, sank the frameless mirrors into the wall, placed bust and
      bronze on their pedestals, and filled up the niches here and there with
      well-bound books, filed regularly in their appointed ranks. An observer
      would have said, &ldquo;This man wishes to imply to you,&mdash;I am not rich; I
      am not ostentatious; I am not luxurious; I am no indolent Sybarite, with
      couches of down, and pictures that provoke the sense; I am no haughty
      noble, with spacious halls, and galleries that awe the echo. But so much
      the greater is my merit if I disdain these excesses of the ease or the
      pride, since I love the elegant, and have a taste! Others may be simple
      and honest, from the very coarseness of their habits; if I, with so much
      refinement and delicacy, am simple and honest,&mdash;reflect, and admire
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the walls of this chamber hung many portraits, most of them represented
      but one face; on the formal pedestals were grouped many busts, most of
      them sculptured but one head. In that small chamber Egotism sat supreme,
      and made the Arts its looking-glasses. Erect in a chair, before a large
      table spread with letters, sat the original of bust and canvas, the owner
      of the apartment. He was alone, yet he sat erect, formal, stiff, precise,
      as if in his very home he was not at ease. His dress was in harmony with
      his posture and his chamber; it affected a neatness of its own,&mdash;foreign
      both to the sumptuous fashions of the deposed nobles, and the filthy
      ruggedness of the sans-culottes. Frizzled and coiffe, not a hair was out
      of order, not a speck lodged on the sleek surface of the blue coat, not a
      wrinkle crumpled the snowy vest, with its under-relief of delicate pink.
      At the first glance, you might have seen in that face nothing but the
      ill-favoured features of a sickly countenance; at a second glance, you
      would have perceived that it had a power, a character of its own. The
      forehead, though low and compressed, was not without that appearance of
      thought and intelligence which, it may be observed, that breadth between
      the eyebrows almost invariably gives; the lips were firm and tightly drawn
      together, yet ever and anon they trembled, and writhed restlessly. The
      eyes, sullen and gloomy, were yet piercing, and full of a concentrated
      vigour that did not seem supported by the thin, feeble frame, or the green
      lividness of the hues, which told of anxiety and disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was Maximilien Robespierre; such the chamber over the menuisier&rsquo;s
      shop, whence issued the edicts that launched armies on their career of
      glory, and ordained an artificial conduit to carry off the blood that
      deluged the metropolis of the most martial people in the globe! Such was
      the man who had resigned a judicial appointment (the early object of his
      ambition) rather than violate his philanthropical principles by
      subscribing to the death of a single fellow-creature; such was the virgin
      enemy to capital punishments; and such, Butcher-Dictator now, was the man
      whose pure and rigid manners, whose incorruptible honesty, whose hatred of
      the excesses that tempt to love and wine, would, had he died five years
      earlier, have left him the model for prudent fathers and careful citizens
      to place before their sons. Such was the man who seemed to have no vice,
      till circumstance, that hotbed, brought forth the two which, in ordinary
      times, lie ever the deepest and most latent in a man&rsquo;s heart,&mdash;Cowardice
      and Envy. To one of these sources is to be traced every murder that
      master-fiend committed. His cowardice was of a peculiar and strange sort;
      for it was accompanied with the most unscrupulous and determined WILL,&mdash;a
      will that Napoleon reverenced; a will of iron, and yet nerves of aspen.
      Mentally, he was a hero,&mdash;physically, a dastard. When the veriest
      shadow of danger threatened his person, the frame cowered, but the will
      swept the danger to the slaughter-house. So there he sat, bolt upright,&mdash;his
      small, lean fingers clenched convulsively; his sullen eyes straining into
      space, their whites yellowed with streaks of corrupt blood; his ears
      literally moving to and fro, like the ignobler animals&rsquo;, to catch every
      sound,&mdash;a Dionysius in his cave; but his posture decorous and
      collected, and every formal hair in its frizzled place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he said in a muttered tone, &ldquo;I hear them; my good Jacobins are
      at their post on the stairs. Pity they swear so! I have a law against
      oaths,&mdash;the manners of the poor and virtuous people must be reformed.
      When all is safe, an example or two amongst those good Jacobins would make
      effect. Faithful fellows, how they love me! Hum!&mdash;what an oath was
      that!&mdash;they need not swear so loud,&mdash;upon the very staircase,
      too! It detracts from my reputation. Ha! steps!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soliloquist glanced at the opposite mirror, and took up a volume; he
      seemed absorbed in its contents, as a tall fellow, a bludgeon in his hand,
      a girdle adorned with pistols round his waist, opened the door, and
      announced two visitors. The one was a young man, said to resemble
      Robespierre in person, but of a far more decided and resolute expression
      of countenance. He entered first, and, looking over the volume in
      Robespierre&rsquo;s hand, for the latter seemed still intent on his lecture,
      exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Rousseau&rsquo;s Heloise? A love-tale!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Payan, it is not the love,&mdash;it is the philosophy that charms
      me. What noble sentiments!&mdash;what ardour of virtue! If Jean Jacques
      had but lived to see this day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the Dictator thus commented on his favourite author, whom in his
      orations he laboured hard to imitate, the second visitor was wheeled into
      the room in a chair. This man was also in what, to most, is the prime of
      life,&mdash;namely, about thirty-eight; but he was literally dead in the
      lower limbs: crippled, paralytic, distorted, he was yet, as the time soon
      came to tell him,&mdash;a Hercules in Crime! But the sweetest of human
      smiles dwelt upon his lips; a beauty almost angelic characterised his
      features (&ldquo;Figure d&rsquo;ange,&rdquo; says one of his contemporaries, in describing
      Couthon. The address, drawn up most probably by Payan (Thermidor 9), after
      the arrest of Robespierre, thus mentions his crippled colleague: &ldquo;Couthon,
      ce citoyen vertueux, QUI N&rsquo;A QUE LE COEUR ET LA TETE DE VIVANS, mais qui
      les a brulants de patriotisme&rdquo; (Couthon, that virtuous citizen, who has
      but the head and the heart of the living, yet possesses these all on flame
      with patriotism.)); an inexpressible aspect of kindness, and the
      resignation of suffering but cheerful benignity, stole into the hearts of
      those who for the first time beheld him. With the most caressing, silver,
      flute-like voice, Citizen Couthon saluted the admirer of Jean Jacques.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&mdash;do not say that it is not the LOVE that attracts thee; it IS
      the love! but not the gross, sensual attachment of man for woman. No! the
      sublime affection for the whole human race, and indeed, for all that
      lives!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Citizen Couthon, bending down, fondled the little spaniel that he
      invariably carried in his bosom, even to the Convention, as a vent for the
      exuberant sensibilities which overflowed his affectionate heart. (This
      tenderness for some pet animal was by no means peculiar to Couthon; it
      seems rather a common fashion with the gentle butchers of the Revolution.
      M. George Duval informs us (&ldquo;Souvenirs de la Terreur,&rdquo; volume iii page
      183) that Chaumette had an aviary, to which he devoted his harmless
      leisure; the murderous Fournier carried on his shoulders a pretty little
      squirrel, attached by a silver chain; Panis bestowed the superfluity of
      his affections upon two gold pheasants; and Marat, who would not abate one
      of the three hundred thousand heads he demanded, REARED DOVES! Apropos of
      the spaniel of Couthon, Duval gives us an amusing anecdote of Sergent, not
      one of the least relentless agents of the massacre of September. A lady
      came to implore his protection for one of her relations confined in the
      Abbaye. He scarcely deigned to speak to her. As she retired in despair,
      she trod by accident on the paw of his favourite spaniel. Sergent, turning
      round, enraged and furious, exclaimed, &ldquo;MADAM, HAVE YOU NO HUMANITY?&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for all that lives,&rdquo; repeated Robespierre, tenderly. &ldquo;Good Couthon,&mdash;poor
      Couthon! Ah, the malice of men!&mdash;how we are misrepresented! To be
      calumniated as the executioners of our colleagues! Ah, it is THAT which
      pierces the heart! To be an object of terror to the enemies of our
      country,&mdash;THAT is noble; but to be an object of terror to the good,
      the patriotic, to those one loves and reveres,&mdash;THAT is the most
      terrible of human tortures at least, to a susceptible and honest heart!&rdquo;
       (Not to fatigue the reader with annotations, I may here observe that
      nearly every sentiment ascribed in the text to Robespierre is to be found
      expressed in his various discourses.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How I love to hear him!&rdquo; ejaculated Couthon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; said Payan, with some impatience. &ldquo;But now to business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, to business!&rdquo; said Robespierre, with a sinister glance from his
      bloodshot eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time has come,&rdquo; said Payan, &ldquo;when the safety of the Republic demands
      a complete concentration of its power. These brawlers of the Comite du
      Salut Public can only destroy; they cannot construct. They hated you,
      Maximilien, from the moment you attempted to replace anarcy by
      institutions. How they mock at the festival which proclaimed the
      acknowledgment of a Supreme Being: they would have no ruler, even in
      heaven! Your clear and vigorous intellect saw that, having wrecked an old
      world, it became necessary to shape a new one. The first step towards
      construction must be to destroy the destroyers. While we deliberate, your
      enemies act. Better this very night to attack the handful of gensdarmes
      that guard them, than to confront the battalions they may raise
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Robespierre, who recoiled before the determined spirit of
      Payan; &ldquo;I have a better and safer plan. This is the 6th of Thermidor; on
      the 10th&mdash;on the 10th, the Convention go in a body to the Fete
      Decadaire. A mob shall form; the canonniers, the troops of Henriot, the
      young pupils de l&rsquo;Ecole de Mars, shall mix in the crowd. Easy, then, to
      strike the conspirators whom we shall designate to our agents. On the same
      day, too, Fouquier and Dumas shall not rest; and a sufficient number of
      &lsquo;the suspect&rsquo; to maintain salutary awe, and keep up the revolutionary
      excitement, shall perish by the glaive of the law. The 10th shall be the
      great day of action. Payan, of these last culprits, have you prepared a
      list?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is here,&rdquo; returned Payan, laconically, presenting a paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robespierre glanced over it rapidly. &ldquo;Collot d&rsquo;Herbois!&mdash;good!
      Barrere!&mdash;ay, it was Barrere who said, &lsquo;Let us strike: the dead alone
      never return.&rsquo; [&lsquo;Frappons! il n&rsquo;y a que les morts qui ne revient pas.&rsquo;&mdash;Barrere.)
      Vadier, the savage jester!&mdash;good&mdash;good! Vadier of the Mountain.
      He has called me &lsquo;Mahomet!&rsquo; Scelerat! blasphemer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mahomet is coming to the Mountain,&rdquo; said Couthon, with his silvery
      accent, as he caressed his spaniel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how is this? I do not see the name of Tallien? Tallien,&mdash;I hate
      that man; that is,&rdquo; said Robespierre, correcting himself with the
      hypocrisy or self-deceit which those who formed the council of this
      phrase-monger exhibited habitually, even among themselves,&mdash;&ldquo;that is,
      Virtue and our Country hate him! There is no man in the whole Convention
      who inspires me with the same horror as Tallien. Couthon, I see a thousand
      Dantons where Tallien sits!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tallien has the only head that belongs to this deformed body,&rdquo; said
      Payan, whose ferocity and crime, like those of St. Just, were not
      unaccompanied by talents of no common order. &ldquo;Were it not better to draw
      away the head, to win, to buy him, for the time, and dispose of him better
      when left alone? He may hate YOU, but he loves MONEY!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Robespierre, writing down the name of Jean Lambert Tallien,
      with a slow hand that shaped each letter with stern distinctness; &ldquo;that
      one head IS MY NECESSITY!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a SMALL list here,&rdquo; said Couthon, sweetly,&mdash;&ldquo;a VERY small
      list. You are dealing with the Mountain; it is necessary to make a few
      examples in the Plain. These moderates are as straws which follow the
      wind. They turned against us yesterday in the Convention. A little terror
      will correct the weathercocks. Poor creatures! I owe them no ill-will; I
      could weep for them. But before all, la chere patrie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The terrible glance of Robespierre devoured the list which the man of
      sensibility submitted to him. &ldquo;Ah, these are well chosen; men not of mark
      enough to be regretted, which is the best policy with the relics of that
      party; some foreigners too,&mdash;yes, THEY have no parents in Paris.
      These wives and parents are beginning to plead against us. Their
      complaints demoralise the guillotine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couthon is right,&rdquo; said Payan; &ldquo;MY list contains those whom it will be
      safer to despatch en masse in the crowd assembled at the Fete. HIS list
      selects those whom we may prudently consign to the law. Shall it not be
      signed at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It IS signed,&rdquo; said Robespierre, formally replacing his pen upon the
      inkstand. &ldquo;Now to more important matters. These deaths will create no
      excitement; but Collot d&rsquo;Herbois, Bourdon De l&rsquo;Oise, Tallien,&rdquo; the last
      name Robespierre gasped as he pronounced, &ldquo;THEY are the heads of parties.
      This is life or death to us as well as them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their heads are the footstools to your curule chair,&rdquo; said Payan, in a
      half whisper. &ldquo;There is no danger if we are bold. Judges, juries, all have
      been your selection. You seize with one hand the army, with the other, the
      law. Your voice yet commands the people&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor and virtuous people,&rdquo; murmured Robespierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And even,&rdquo; continued Payan, &ldquo;if our design at the Fete fail us, we must
      not shrink from the resources still at our command. Reflect! Henriot, the
      general of the Parisian army, furnishes you with troops to arrest; the
      Jacobin Club with a public to approve; inexorable Dumas with judges who
      never acquit. We must be bold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we ARE bold,&rdquo; exclaimed Robespierre, with sudden passion, and
      striking his hand on the table as he rose, with his crest erect, as a
      serpent in the act to strike. &ldquo;In seeing the multitude of vices that the
      revolutionary torrent mingles with civic virtues, I tremble to be sullied
      in the eyes of posterity by the impure neighbourhood of these perverse men
      who thrust themselves among the sincere defenders of humanity. What!&mdash;they
      think to divide the country like a booty! I thank them for their hatred to
      all that is virtuous and worthy! These men,&rdquo;&mdash;and he grasped the list
      of Payan in his hand,&mdash;&ldquo;these!&mdash;not WE&mdash;have drawn the line
      of demarcation between themselves and the lovers of France!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, we must reign alone!&rdquo; muttered Payan; &ldquo;in other words, the state
      needs unity of will;&rdquo; working, with his strong practical mind, the
      corollary from the logic of his word-compelling colleague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go to the Convention,&rdquo; continued Robespierre. &ldquo;I have absented
      myself too long,&mdash;lest I might seem to overawe the Republic that I
      have created. Away with such scruples! I will prepare the people! I will
      blast the traitors with a look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with the terrible firmness of the orator that had never failed,&mdash;of
      the moral will that marched like a warrior on the cannon. At that instant
      he was interrupted; a letter was brought to him: he opened it,&mdash;his
      face fell, he shook from limb to limb; it was one of the anonymous
      warnings by which the hate and revenge of those yet left alive to threaten
      tortured the death-giver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art smeared,&rdquo; ran the lines, &ldquo;with the best blood of France. Read
      thy sentence! I await the hour when the people shall knell thee to the
      doomsman. If my hope deceive me, if deferred too long,&mdash;hearken,
      read! This hand, which thine eyes shall search in vain to discover, shall
      pierce thy heart. I see thee every day,&mdash;I am with thee every day. At
      each hour my arm rises against thy breast. Wretch! live yet awhile, though
      but for few and miserable days&mdash;live to think of me; sleep to dream
      of me! Thy terror and thy thought of me are the heralds of thy doom.
      Adieu! this day itself I go forth to riot on thy fears!&rdquo; (See &ldquo;Papiers
      inedits trouves chez Robespierre,&rdquo; etc., volume ii. page 155. (No. lx.))
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your lists are not full enough!&rdquo; said the tyrant, with a hollow voice, as
      the paper dropped from his trembling hand. &ldquo;Give them to me!&mdash;give
      them to me! Think again, think again! Barrere is right&mdash;right!
      &lsquo;Frappons! il n&rsquo;y a que les morts qui ne revient pas!&rsquo;&rdquo;

</pre>
    <p>
      While such the designs and fears of Maximilien Robespierre, common danger,
      common hatred, whatever was yet left of mercy or of virtue in the agents
      of the Revolution, served to unite strange opposites in hostility to the
      universal death-dealer. There was, indeed, an actual conspiracy at work
      against him among men little less bespattered than himself with innocent
      blood. But that conspiracy would have been idle of itself, despite the
      abilities of Tallien and Barras (the only men whom it comprised, worthy,
      by foresight and energy, the names of &ldquo;leaders&rdquo;). The sure and destroying
      elements that gathered round the tyrant were Time and Nature; the one,
      which he no longer suited; the other, which he had outraged and stirred up
      in the human breast. The most atrocious party of the Revolution, the
      followers of Hebert, gone to his last account, the butcher-atheists, who,
      in desecrating heaven and earth, still arrogated inviolable sanctity to
      themselves, were equally enraged at the execution of their filthy chief,
      and the proclamation of a Supreme Being. The populace, brutal as it had
      been, started as from a dream of blood, when their huge idol, Danton, no
      longer filled the stage of terror, rendering crime popular by that
      combination of careless frankness and eloquent energy which endears their
      heroes to the herd. The glaive of the guillotine had turned against
      THEMSELVES. They had yelled and shouted, and sung and danced, when the
      venerable age, or the gallant youth, of aristocracy or letters, passed by
      their streets in the dismal tumbrils; but they shut up their shops, and
      murmured to each other, when their own order was invaded, and tailors and
      cobblers, and journeymen and labourers, were huddled off to the embraces
      of the &ldquo;Holy Mother Guillotine,&rdquo; with as little ceremony as if they had
      been the Montmorencies or the La Tremouilles, the Malesherbes or the
      Lavoisiers. &ldquo;At this time,&rdquo; said Couthon, justly, &ldquo;Les ombres de Danton,
      d&rsquo;Hebert, de Chaumette, se promenent parmi nous!&rdquo; (The shades of Danton,
      Hebert, and Chaumette walk amongst us.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those who had shared the doctrines, and who now dreaded the fate of
      the atheist Hebert, was the painter, Jean Nicot. Mortified and enraged to
      find that, by the death of his patron, his career was closed; and that, in
      the zenith of the Revolution for which he had laboured, he was lurking in
      caves and cellars, more poor, more obscure, more despicable than he had
      been at the commencement,&mdash;not daring to exercise even his art, and
      fearful every hour that his name would swell the lists of the condemned,&mdash;he
      was naturally one of the bitterest enemies of Robespierre and his
      government. He held secret meetings with Collot d&rsquo;Herbois, who was
      animated by the same spirit; and with the creeping and furtive craft that
      characterised his abilities, he contrived, undetected, to disseminate
      tracts and invectives against the Dictator, and to prepare, amidst &ldquo;the
      poor and virtuous people,&rdquo; the train for the grand explosion. But still so
      firm to the eyes, even of profounder politicians than Jean Nicot, appeared
      the sullen power of the incorruptible Maximilien; so timorous was the
      movement against him,&mdash;that Nicot, in common with many others, placed
      his hopes rather in the dagger of the assassin than the revolt of the
      multitude. But Nicot, though not actually a coward, shrunk himself from
      braving the fate of the martyr; he had sense enough to see that, though
      all parties might rejoice in the assassination, all parties would probably
      concur in beheading the assassin. He had not the virtue to become a
      Brutus. His object was to inspire a proxy-Brutus; and in the centre of
      that inflammable population this was no improbable hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst those loudest and sternest against the reign of blood; amongst
      those most disenchanted of the Revolution; amongst those most appalled by
      its excesses,&mdash;was, as might be expected, the Englishman, Clarence
      Glyndon. The wit and accomplishments, the uncertain virtues that had
      lighted with fitful gleams the mind of Camille Desmoulins, had fascinated
      Glyndon more than the qualities of any other agent in the Revolution. And
      when (for Camille Desmoulins had a heart, which seemed dead or dormant in
      most of his contemporaries) that vivid child of genius and of error,
      shocked at the massacre of the Girondins, and repentant of his own efforts
      against them, began to rouse the serpent malice of Robespierre by new
      doctrines of mercy and toleration, Glyndon espoused his views with his
      whole strength and soul. Camille Desmoulins perished, and Glyndon,
      hopeless at once of his own life and the cause of humanity, from that time
      sought only the occasion of flight from the devouring Golgotha. He had two
      lives to heed besides his own; for them he trembled, and for them he
      schemed and plotted the means of escape. Though Glyndon hated the
      principles, the party (None were more opposed to the Hebertists than
      Camille Desmoulins and his friends. It is curious and amusing to see these
      leaders of the mob, calling the mob &ldquo;the people&rdquo; one day, and the
      &ldquo;canaille&rdquo; the next, according as it suits them. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; says Camille,
      &ldquo;that they (the Hebertists) have all the canaille with them.&rdquo;&mdash;(Ils
      ont toute la canaille pour eux.)), and the vices of Nicot, he yet extended
      to the painter&rsquo;s penury the means of subsistence; and Jean Nicot, in
      return, designed to exalt Glyndon to that very immortality of a Brutus
      from which he modestly recoiled himself. He founded his designs on the
      physical courage, on the wild and unsettled fancies of the English artist,
      and on the vehement hate and indignant loathing with which he openly
      regarded the government of Maximilien.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same hour, on the same day in July, in which Robespierre conferred
      (as we have seen) with his allies, two persons were seated in a small room
      in one of the streets leading out of the Rue St. Honore; the one, a man,
      appeared listening impatiently, and with a sullen brow, to his companion,
      a woman of singular beauty, but with a bold and reckless expression, and
      her face as she spoke was animated by the passions of a half-savage and
      vehement nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Englishman,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;beware!&mdash;you know that, whether in
      flight or at the place of death, I would brave all to be by your side,&mdash;you
      know THAT! Speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Fillide; did I ever doubt your fidelity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubt it you cannot,&mdash;betray it you may. You tell me that in flight
      you must have a companion besides myself, and that companion is a female.
      It shall not be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall not!&rdquo; repeated Fillide, firmly, and folding her arms across her
      breast. Before Glyndon could reply, a slight knock at the door was heard,
      and Nicot opened the latch and entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fillide sank into her chair, and, leaning her face on her hands, appeared
      unheeding of the intruder and the conversation that ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot bid thee good-day, Glyndon,&rdquo; said Nicot, as in his sans-culotte
      fashion he strode towards the artist, his ragged hat on his head, his
      hands in his pockets, and the beard of a week&rsquo;s growth upon his chin,&mdash;&ldquo;I
      cannot bid thee good-day; for while the tyrant lives, evil is every sun
      that sheds its beams on France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true; what then? We have sown the wind, we must reap the
      whirlwind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Nicot, apparently not heeding the reply, and as if
      musingly to himself, &ldquo;it is strange to think that the butcher is as mortal
      as the butchered; that his life hangs on as slight a thread; that between
      the cuticle and the heart there is as short a passage,&mdash;that, in
      short, one blow can free France and redeem mankind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon surveyed the speaker with a careless and haughty scorn, and made
      no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; proceeded Nicot, &ldquo;I have sometimes looked round for the man born
      for this destiny, and whenever I have done so, my steps have led me
      hither!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should they not rather have led thee to the side of Maximilien
      Robespierre?&rdquo; said Glyndon, with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Nicot, coldly,&mdash;&ldquo;no; for I am a &lsquo;suspect:&rsquo; I could not
      mix with his train; I could not approach within a hundred yards of his
      person, but I should be seized; YOU, as yet, are safe. Hear me!&rdquo;&mdash;and
      his voice became earnest and expressive,&mdash;&ldquo;hear me! There seems
      danger in this action; there is none. I have been with Collot d&rsquo;Herbois
      and Bilaud-Varennes; they will hold him harmless who strikes the blow; the
      populace would run to thy support; the Convention would hail thee as their
      deliverer, the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold, man! How darest thou couple my name with the act of an assassin?
      Let the tocsin sound from yonder tower, to a war between Humanity and the
      Tyrant, and I will not be the last in the field; but liberty never yet
      acknowledged a defender in a felon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something so brave and noble in Glyndon&rsquo;s voice, mien, and
      manner, as he thus spoke, that Nicot at once was silenced; at once he saw
      that he had misjudged the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Fillide, lifting her face from her hands,&mdash;&ldquo;no! your
      friend has a wiser scheme in preparation; he would leave you wolves to
      mangle each other. He is right; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flight!&rdquo; exclaimed Nicot; &ldquo;is it possible? Flight; how?&mdash;when?&mdash;by
      what means? All France begirt with spies and guards! Flight! would to
      Heaven it were in our power!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dost thou, too, desire to escape the blessed Revolution?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Desire! Oh!&rdquo; cried Nicot, suddenly, and, falling down, he clasped
      Glyndon&rsquo;s knees,&mdash;&ldquo;oh, save me with thyself! My life is a torture;
      every moment the guillotine frowns before me. I know that my hours are
      numbered; I know that the tyrant waits but his time to write my name in
      his inexorable list; I know that Rene Dumas, the judge who never pardons,
      has, from the first, resolved upon my death. Oh, Glyndon, by our old
      friendship, by our common art, by thy loyal English faith and good English
      heart, let me share thy flight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If thou wilt, so be it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks!&mdash;my whole life shall thank thee. But how hast thou prepared
      the means, the passports, the disguise, the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell thee. Thou knowest C&mdash;, of the Convention,&mdash;he has
      power, and he is covetous. &lsquo;Qu&rsquo;on me meprise, pourvu que je dine&rsquo; (Let
      them despise me, provided that I dine.), said he, when reproached for his
      avarice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the help of this sturdy republican, who has friends enough in the
      Comite, I have obtained the means necessary for flight; I have purchased
      them. For a consideration I can procure thy passport also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy riches, then, are not in assignats?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I have gold enough for us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And here Glyndon, beckoning Nicot into the next room, first briefly and
      rapidly detailed to him the plan proposed, and the disguises to be assumed
      conformably to the passports, and then added, &ldquo;In return for the service I
      render thee, grant me one favour, which I think is in thy power. Thou
      rememberest Viola Pisani?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&mdash;remember, yes!&mdash;and the lover with whom she fled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And FROM whom she is a fugitive now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed&mdash;what!&mdash;I understand. Sacre bleu! but you are a lucky
      fellow, cher confrere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence, man! with thy eternal prate of brotherhood and virtue, thou
      seemest never to believe in one kindly action, or one virtuous thought!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicot bit his lip, and replied sullenly, &ldquo;Experience is a great
      undeceiver. Humph! What service can I do thee with regard to the Italian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been accessory to her arrival in this city of snares and pitfalls.
      I cannot leave her alone amidst dangers from which neither innocence nor
      obscurity is a safeguard. In your blessed Republic, a good and unsuspected
      citizen, who casts a desire on any woman, maid or wife, has but to say,
      &lsquo;Be mine, or I denounce you!&rsquo; In a word, Viola must share our flight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What so easy? I see your passports provide for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What so easy? What so difficult? This Fillide&mdash;would that I had
      never seen her!&mdash;would that I had never enslaved my soul to my
      senses! The love of an uneducated, violent, unprincipled woman, opens with
      a heaven, to merge in a hell! She is jealous as all the Furies; she will
      not hear of a female companion; and when once she sees the beauty of
      Viola!&mdash;I tremble to think of it. She is capable of any excess in the
      storm of her passions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha, I know what such women are! My wife, Beatrice Sacchini, whom I took
      from Naples, when I failed with this very Viola, divorced me when my money
      failed, and, as the mistress of a judge, passes me in her carriage while I
      crawl through the streets. Plague on her!&mdash;but patience, patience!
      such is the lot of virtue. Would I were Robespierre for a day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cease these tirades!&rdquo; exclaimed Glyndon, impatiently; &ldquo;and to the point.
      What would you advise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave your Fillide behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave her to her own ignorance; leave her unprotected even by the mind;
      leave her in the Saturnalia of Rape and Murder? No! I have sinned against
      her once. But come what may, I will not so basely desert one who, with all
      her errors, trusted her fate to my love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You deserted her at Marseilles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; but I left her in safety, and I did not then believe her love to be
      so deep and faithful. I left her gold, and I imagined she would be easily
      consoled; but since THEN WE HAVE KNOWN DANGER TOGETHER! And now to leave
      her alone to that danger which she would never have incurred but for
      devotion to me!&mdash;no, that is impossible. A project occurs to me.
      Canst thou not say that thou hast a sister, a relative, or a benefactress,
      whom thou wouldst save? Can we not&mdash;till we have left France&mdash;make
      Fillide believe that Viola is one in whom THOU only art interested; and
      whom, for thy sake only, I permit to share in our escape?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, well thought of!&mdash;certainly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will then appear to yield to Fillide&rsquo;s wishes, and resign the project,
      which she so resents, of saving the innocent object of her frantic
      jealousy. You, meanwhile, shall yourself entreat Fillide to intercede with
      me to extend the means of escape to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a lady (she knows I have no sister) who has aided me in my distress.
      Yes, I will manage all, never fear. One word more,&mdash;what has become
      of that Zanoni?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk not of him,&mdash;I know not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he love this girl still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would seem so. She is his wife, the mother of his infant, who is with
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wife!&mdash;mother! He loves her. Aha! And why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No questions now. I will go and prepare Viola for the flight; you,
      meanwhile, return to Fillide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the address of the Neapolitan? It is necessary I should know, lest
      Fillide inquire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rue M&mdash; T&mdash;, No. 27. Adieu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon seized his hat and hastened from the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicot, left alone, seemed for a few moments buried in thought. &ldquo;Oho,&rdquo; he
      muttered to himself, &ldquo;can I not turn all this to my account? Can I not
      avenge myself on thee, Zanoni, as I have so often sworn,&mdash;through thy
      wife and child? Can I not possess myself of thy gold, thy passports, and
      thy Fillide, hot Englishman, who wouldst humble me with thy loathed
      benefits, and who hast chucked me thine alms as to a beggar? And Fillide,
      I love her: and thy gold, I love THAT more! Puppets, I move your strings!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He passed slowly into the chamber where Fillide yet sat, with gloomy
      thought on her brow and tears standing in her dark eyes. She looked up
      eagerly as the door opened, and turned from the rugged face of Nicot with
      an impatient movement of disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glyndon,&rdquo; said the painter, drawing a chair to Fillide&rsquo;s, &ldquo;has left me to
      enliven your solitude, fair Italian. He is not jealous of the ugly Nicot!&mdash;ha,
      ha!&mdash;yet Nicot loved thee well once, when his fortunes were more
      fair. But enough of such past follies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend, then, has left the house. Whither? Ah, you look away; you
      falter,&mdash;you cannot meet my eyes! Speak! I implore, I command thee,
      speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enfant! And what dost thou fear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;FEAR!&mdash;yes, alas, I fear!&rdquo; said the Italian; and her whole frame
      seemed to shrink into itself as she fell once more back into her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after a pause, she tossed the long hair from her eyes, and, starting
      up abruptly, paced the room with disordered strides. At length she stopped
      opposite to Nicot, laid her hand on his arm, drew him towards an
      escritoire, which she unlocked, and, opening a well, pointed to the gold
      that lay within, and said, &ldquo;Thou art poor,&mdash;thou lovest money; take
      what thou wilt, but undeceive me. Who is this woman whom thy friend
      visits,&mdash;and does he love her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicot&rsquo;s eyes sparkled, and his hands opened and clenched, and clenched and
      opened, as he gazed upon the coins. But reluctantly resisting the impulse,
      he said, with an affected bitterness, &ldquo;Thinkest thou to bribe me?&mdash;if
      so, it cannot be with gold. But what if he does love a rival; what if he
      betrays thee; what if, wearied by thy jealousies, he designs in his flight
      to leave thee behind,&mdash;would such knowledge make thee happier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; exclaimed the Italian, fiercely; &ldquo;yes, for it would be happiness to
      hate and to be avenged! Oh, thou knowest not how sweet is hatred to those
      who have really loved!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But wilt thou swear, if I reveal to thee the secret, that thou wilt not
      betray me,&mdash;that thou wilt not fall, as women do, into weak tears and
      fond reproaches, when thy betrayer returns?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tears, reproaches! Revenge hides itself in smiles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art a brave creature!&rdquo; said Nicot, almost admiringly. &ldquo;One condition
      more: thy lover designs to fly with his new love, to leave thee to thy
      fate; if I prove this to thee, and if I give thee revenge against thy
      rival, wilt thou fly with me? I love thee!&mdash;I will wed thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fillide&rsquo;s eyes flashed fire; she looked at him with unutterable disdain,
      and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicot felt he had gone too far; and with that knowledge of the evil part
      of our nature which his own heart and association with crime had taught
      him, he resolved to trust the rest to the passions of the Italian, when
      raised to the height to which he was prepared to lead them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;my love made me too presumptuous; and yet it is
      only that love,&mdash;my sympathy for thee, beautiful and betrayed, that
      can induce me to wrong, with my revelations, one whom I have regarded as a
      brother. I can depend upon thine oath to conceal all from Glyndon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my oath and my wrongs and my mountain blood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough! get thy hat and mantle, and follow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Fillide left the room, Nicot&rsquo;s eyes again rested on the gold; it was
      much,&mdash;much more than he had dared to hope for; and as he peered into
      the well and opened the drawers, he perceived a packet of letters in the
      well-known hand of Camille Desmoulins. He seized&mdash;he opened the
      packet; his looks brightened as he glanced over a few sentences. &ldquo;This
      would give fifty Glyndons to the guillotine!&rdquo; he muttered, and thrust the
      packet into his bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      O artist!&mdash;O haunted one!&mdash;O erring genius!&mdash;behold the two
      worst foes,&mdash;the False Ideal that knows no God, and the False Love
      that burns from the corruption of the senses, and takes no lustre from the
      soul!

      Letter from Zanoni to Mejnour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dost thou remember in the old time, when the Beautiful yet dwelt in
      Greece, how we two, in the vast Athenian Theatre, witnessed the birth of
      Words as undying as ourselves? Dost thou remember the thrill of terror
      that ran through that mighty audience, when the wild Cassandra burst from
      her awful silence to shriek to her relentless god! How ghastly, at the
      entrance of the House of Atreus, about to become her tomb, rang out her
      exclamations of foreboding woe: &ldquo;Dwelling abhorred of heaven!&mdash;human
      shamble-house and floor blood-bespattered!&rdquo; (Aesch. &ldquo;Agam.&rdquo; 1098.) Dost
      thou remember how, amidst the breathless awe of those assembled thousands,
      I drew close to thee, and whispered, &ldquo;Verily, no prophet like the poet!
      This scene of fabled horror comes to me as a dream, shadowing forth some
      likeness in my own remoter future!&rdquo; As I enter this slaughter-house that
      scene returns to me, and I hearken to the voice of Cassandra ringing in my
      ears. A solemn and warning dread gathers round me, as if I too were come
      to find a grave, and &ldquo;the Net of Hades&rdquo; had already entangled me in its
      web! What dark treasure-houses of vicissitude and woe are our memories
      become! What our lives, but the chronicles of unrelenting death! It seems
      to me as yesterday when I stood in the streets of this city of the Gaul,
      as they shone with plumed chivalry, and the air rustled with silken
      braveries. Young Louis, the monarch and the lover, was victor of the
      Tournament at the Carousel; and all France felt herself splendid in the
      splendour of her gorgeous chief! Now there is neither throne nor altar;
      and what is in their stead? I see it yonder&mdash;the GUILLOTINE! It is
      dismal to stand amidst the ruins of mouldering cities, to startle the
      serpent and the lizard amidst the wrecks of Persepolis and Thebes; but
      more dismal still to stand as I&mdash;the stranger from Empires that have
      ceased to be&mdash;stand now amidst the yet ghastlier ruins of Law and
      Order, the shattering of mankind themselves! Yet here, even here, Love,
      the Beautifier, that hath led my steps, can walk with unshrinking hope
      through the wilderness of Death. Strange is the passion that makes a world
      in itself, that individualises the One amidst the Multitude; that, through
      all the changes of my solemn life, yet survives, though ambition and hate
      and anger are dead; the one solitary angel, hovering over a universe of
      tombs on its two tremulous and human wings,&mdash;Hope and Fear!
    </p>
    <p>
      How is it, Mejnour, that, as my diviner art abandoned me,&mdash;as, in my
      search for Viola, I was aided but by the ordinary instincts of the merest
      mortal,&mdash;how is it that I have never desponded, that I have felt in
      every difficulty the prevailing prescience that we should meet at last? So
      cruelly was every vestige of her flight concealed from me,&mdash;so
      suddenly, so secretly had she fled, that all the spies, all the
      authorities of Venice, could give me no clew. All Italy I searched in
      vain! Her young home at Naples!&mdash;how still, in its humble chambers,
      there seemed to linger the fragrance of her presence! All the sublimest
      secrets of our lore failed me,&mdash;failed to bring her soul visible to
      mine; yet morning and night, thou lone and childless one, morning and
      night, detached from myself, I can commune with my child! There in that
      most blessed, typical, and mysterious of all relations, Nature herself
      appears to supply what Science would refuse. Space cannot separate the
      father&rsquo;s watchful soul from the cradle of his first-born! I know not of
      its resting-place and home,&mdash;my visions picture not the land,&mdash;only
      the small and tender life to which all space is as yet the heritage! For
      to the infant, before reason dawns,&mdash;before man&rsquo;s bad passions can
      dim the essence that it takes from the element it hath left, there is no
      peculiar country, no native city, and no mortal language. Its soul as yet
      is the denizen of all airs and of every world; and in space its soul meets
      with mine,&mdash;the child communes with the father! Cruel and forsaking
      one,&mdash;thou for whom I left the wisdom of the spheres; thou whose
      fatal dower has been the weakness and terrors of humanity,&mdash;couldst
      thou think that young soul less safe on earth because I would lead it ever
      more up to heaven! Didst thou think that I could have wronged mine own?
      Didst thou not know that in its serenest eyes the life that I gave it
      spoke to warn, to upbraid the mother who would bind it to the darkness and
      pangs of the prison-house of clay? Didst thou not feel that it was I who,
      permitted by the Heavens, shielded it from suffering and disease? And in
      its wondrous beauty, I blessed the holy medium through which, at last, my
      spirit might confer with thine!
    </p>
    <p>
      And how have I tracked them hither? I learned that thy pupil had been at
      Venice. I could not trace the young and gentle neophyte of Parthenope in
      the description of the haggard and savage visitor who had come to Viola
      before she fled; but when I would have summoned his IDEA before me, it
      refused to obey; and I knew then that his fate had become entwined with
      Viola&rsquo;s. I have tracked him, then, to this Lazar House. I arrived but
      yesterday; I have not yet discovered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      I have just returned from their courts of justice,&mdash;dens where tigers
      arraign their prey. I find not whom I would seek. They are saved as yet;
      but I recognise in the crimes of mortals the dark wisdom of the
      Everlasting. Mejnour, I see here, for the first time, how majestic and
      beauteous a thing is death! Of what sublime virtues we robbed ourselves,
      when, in the thirst for virtue, we attained the art by which we can refuse
      to die! When in some happy clime, where to breathe is to enjoy, the
      charnel-house swallows up the young and fair; when in the noble pursuit of
      knowledge, Death comes to the student, and shuts out the enchanted land
      which was opening to his gaze,&mdash;how natural for us to desire to live;
      how natural to make perpetual life the first object of research! But here,
      from my tower of time, looking over the darksome past, and into the starry
      future, I learn how great hearts feel what sweetness and glory there is to
      die for the things they love! I saw a father sacrificing himself for his
      son; he was subjected to charges which a word of his could dispel,&mdash;he
      was mistaken for his boy. With what joy he seized the error, confessed the
      noble crimes of valour and fidelity which the son had indeed committed,
      and went to the doom, exulting that his death saved the life he had given,
      not in vain! I saw women, young, delicate, in the bloom of their beauty;
      they had vowed themselves to the cloister. Hands smeared with the blood of
      saints opened the gate that had shut them from the world, and bade them go
      forth, forget their vows, forswear the Divine one these demons would
      depose, find lovers and helpmates, and be free. And some of these young
      hearts had loved, and even, though in struggles, loved yet. Did they
      forswear the vow? Did they abandon the faith? Did even love allure them?
      Mejnour, with one voice, they preferred to die. And whence comes this
      courage?&mdash;because such HEARTS LIVE IN SOME MORE ABSTRACT AND HOLIER
      LIFE THAN THEIR OWN. BUT TO LIVE FOREVER UPON THIS EARTH IS TO LIVE IN
      NOTHING DIVINER THAN OURSELVES. Yes, even amidst this gory butcherdom,
      God, the Ever-living, vindicates to man the sanctity of His servant,
      Death!
    </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I have seen thee in spirit; I have seen and blessed thee, my sweet
      child! Dost thou not know me also in thy dreams? Dost thou not feel the
      beating of my heart through the veil of thy rosy slumbers? Dost thou not
      hear the wings of the brighter beings that I yet can conjure around thee,
      to watch, to nourish, and to save? And when the spell fades at thy waking,
      when thine eyes open to the day, will they not look round for me, and ask
      thy mother, with their mute eloquence, &ldquo;Why she has robbed thee of a
      father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Woman, dost thou not repent thee? Flying from imaginary fears, hast thou
      not come to the very lair of terror, where Danger sits visible and
      incarnate? Oh, if we could but meet, wouldst thou not fall upon the bosom
      thou hast so wronged, and feel, poor wanderer amidst the storms, as if
      thou hadst regained the shelter? Mejnour, still my researches fail me. I
      mingle with all men, even their judges and their spies, but I cannot yet
      gain the clew. I know that she is here. I know it by an instinct; the
      breath of my child seems warmer and more familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      They peer at me with venomous looks, as I pass through their streets. With
      a glance I disarm their malice, and fascinate the basilisks. Everywhere I
      see the track and scent the presence of the Ghostly One that dwells on the
      Threshold, and whose victims are the souls that would ASPIRE, and can only
      FEAR. I see its dim shapelessness going before the men of blood, and
      marshalling their way. Robespierre passed me with his furtive step. Those
      eyes of horror were gnawing into his heart. I looked down upon their
      senate; the grim Phantom sat cowering on its floor. It hath taken up its
      abode in the city of Dread. And what in truth are these would-be builders
      of a new world? Like the students who have vainly struggled after our
      supreme science, they have attempted what is beyond their power; they have
      passed from this solid earth of usages and forms into the land of shadow,
      and its loathsome keeper has seized them as its prey. I looked into the
      tyrant&rsquo;s shuddering soul, as it trembled past me. There, amidst the ruins
      of a thousand systems which aimed at virtue, sat Crime, and shivered at
      its desolation. Yet this man is the only Thinker, the only Aspirant,
      amongst them all. He still looks for a future of peace and mercy, to
      begin,&mdash;ay! at what date? When he has swept away every foe. Fool! new
      foes spring from every drop of blood. Led by the eyes of the Unutterable,
      he is walking to his doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      O Viola, thy innocence protects thee! Thou whom the sweet humanities of
      love shut out even from the dreams of aerial and spiritual beauty, making
      thy heart a universe of visions fairer than the wanderer over the rosy
      Hesperus can survey,&mdash;shall not the same pure affection encompass
      thee, even here, with a charmed atmosphere, and terror itself fall
      harmless on a life too innocent for wisdom?

      CHAPTER 7.IV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Ombra piu che di notte, in cui di luce
     Raggio misto non e;

     ....

     Ne piu il palagio appar, ne piu le sue
     Vestigia; ne dir puossi&mdash;egli qui fue.
     &mdash;&ldquo;Ger. Lib.&rdquo;, canto xvi.-lxix.

     (Darkness greater than of night, in which not a ray of light is
     mixed;...The palace appears no more:  not even a vestige,&mdash;nor
     can one say that it has been.)
</pre>
    <p>
      The clubs are noisy with clamorous frenzy; the leaders are grim with
      schemes. Black Henriot flies here and there, muttering to his armed
      troops, &ldquo;Robespierre, your beloved, is in danger!&rdquo; Robespierre stalks
      perturbed, his list of victims swelling every hour. Tallien, the Macduff
      to the doomed Macbeth, is whispering courage to his pale conspirators.
      Along the streets heavily roll the tumbrils. The shops are closed,&mdash;the
      people are gorged with gore, and will lap no more. And night after night,
      to the eighty theatres flock the children of the Revolution, to laugh at
      the quips of comedy, and weep gentle tears over imaginary woes!
    </p>
    <p>
      In a small chamber, in the heart of the city, sits the mother, watching
      over her child. It is quiet, happy noon; the sunlight, broken by the tall
      roofs in the narrow street, comes yet through the open casement, the
      impartial playfellow of the air, gleesome alike in temple and prison, hall
      and hovel; as golden and as blithe, whether it laugh over the first hour
      of life, or quiver in its gay delight on the terror and agony of the last!
      The child, where it lay at the feet of Viola, stretched out its dimpled
      hands as if to clasp the dancing motes that revelled in the beam. The
      mother turned her eyes from the glory; it saddened her yet more. She
      turned and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is this the same Viola who bloomed fairer than their own Idalia under the
      skies of Greece? How changed! How pale and worn! She sat listlessly, her
      arms dropping on her knee; the smile that was habitual to her lips was
      gone. A heavy, dull despondency, as if the life of life were no more,
      seemed to weigh down her youth, and make it weary of that happy sun! In
      truth, her existence had languished away since it had wandered, as some
      melancholy stream, from the source that fed it. The sudden enthusiasm of
      fear or superstition that had almost, as if still in the unconscious
      movements of a dream, led her to fly from Zanoni, had ceased from the day
      which dawned upon her in a foreign land. Then&mdash;there&mdash;she felt
      that in the smile she had evermore abandoned lived her life. She did not
      repent,&mdash;she would not have recalled the impulse that winged her
      flight. Though the enthusiasm was gone, the superstition yet remained; she
      still believed she had saved her child from that dark and guilty sorcery,
      concerning which the traditions of all lands are prodigal, but in none do
      they find such credulity, or excite such dread, as in the South of Italy.
      This impression was confirmed by the mysterious conversations of Glyndon,
      and by her own perception of the fearful change that had passed over one
      who represented himself as the victim of the enchanters. She did not,
      therefore, repent; but her very volition seemed gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their arrival at Paris, Viola saw her companion&mdash;the faithful wife&mdash;no
      more. Ere three weeks were passed, husband and wife had ceased to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, for the first time, the drudgeries of this hard earth claimed the
      beautiful Neapolitan. In that profession, giving voice and shape to poetry
      and song, in which her first years were passed, there is, while it lasts,
      an excitement in the art that lifts it from the labour of a calling.
      Hovering between two lives, the Real and Ideal, dwells the life of music
      and the stage. But that life was lost evermore to the idol of the eyes and
      ears of Naples. Lifted to the higher realm of passionate love, it seemed
      as if the fictitious genius which represents the thoughts of others was
      merged in the genius that grows all thought itself. It had been the worst
      infidelity to the Lost, to have descended again to live on the applause of
      others. And so&mdash;for she would not accept alms from Glyndon&mdash;so,
      by the commonest arts, the humblest industry which the sex knows, alone
      and unseen, she who had slept on the breast of Zanoni found a shelter for
      their child. As when, in the noble verse prefixed to this chapter, Armida
      herself has destroyed her enchanted palace,&mdash;not a vestige of that
      bower, raised of old by Poetry and Love, remained to say, &ldquo;It had been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the child avenged the father; it bloomed, it thrived,&mdash;it waxed
      strong in the light of life. But still it seemed haunted and preserved by
      some other being than her own. In its sleep there was that slumber, so
      deep and rigid, which a thunderbolt could not have disturbed; and in such
      sleep often it moved its arms, as to embrace the air: often its lips
      stirred with murmured sounds of indistinct affection,&mdash;NOT FOR HER;
      and all the while upon its cheeks a hue of such celestial bloom, upon its
      lips a smile of such mysterious joy! Then, when it waked, its eyes did not
      turn first to HER,&mdash;wistful, earnest, wandering, they roved around,
      to fix on her pale face, at last, in mute sorrow and reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had Viola felt before how mighty was her love for Zanoni; how
      thought, feeling, heart, soul, life,&mdash;all lay crushed and dormant in
      the icy absence to which she had doomed herself! She heard not the roar
      without, she felt not one amidst those stormy millions,&mdash;worlds of
      excitement labouring through every hour. Only when Glyndon, haggard, wan,
      and spectre-like, glided in, day after day, to visit her, did the fair
      daughter of the careless South know how heavy and universal was the
      Death-Air that girt her round. Sublime in her passive unconsciousness,&mdash;her
      mechanic life,&mdash;she sat, and feared not, in the den of the Beasts of
      Prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of the room opened abruptly, and Glyndon entered. His manner was
      more agitated than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you, Clarence?&rdquo; she said in her soft, languid tones. &ldquo;You are
      before the hour I expected you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can count on his hours at Paris?&rdquo; returned Glyndon, with a frightful
      smile. &ldquo;Is it not enough that I am here! Your apathy in the midst of these
      sorrows appalls me. You say calmly, &lsquo;Farewell;&rsquo; calmly you bid me,
      &lsquo;Welcome!&lsquo;&mdash;as if in every corner there was not a spy, and as
      if with every day there was not a massacre!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me! But in these walls lies my world. I can hardly credit all the
      tales you tell me. Everything here, save THAT,&rdquo; and she pointed to the
      infant, &ldquo;seems already so lifeless, that in the tomb itself one could
      scarcely less heed the crimes that are done without.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon paused for a few moments, and gazed with strange and mingled
      feelings upon that face and form, still so young, and yet so invested with
      that saddest of all repose,&mdash;when the heart feels old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Viola,&rdquo; said he, at last, and in a voice of suppressed passion, &ldquo;was it
      thus I ever thought to see you,&mdash;ever thought to feel for you, when
      we two first met in the gay haunts of Naples? Ah, why then did you refuse
      my love; or why was mine not worthy of you? Nay, shrink not!&mdash;let me
      touch your hand. No passion so sweet as that youthful love can return to
      me again. I feel for you but as a brother for some younger and lonely
      sister. With you, in your presence, sad though it be, I seem to breathe
      back the purer air of my early life. Here alone, except in scenes of
      turbulence and tempest, the Phantom ceases to pursue me. I forget even the
      Death that stalks behind, and haunts me as my shadow. But better days may
      be in store for us yet. Viola, I at last begin dimly to perceive how to
      baffle and subdue the Phantom that has cursed my life,&mdash;it is to
      brave, and defy it. In sin and in riot, as I have told thee, it haunts me
      not. But I comprehend now what Mejnour said in his dark apothegms, &lsquo;that I
      should dread the spectre most WHEN UNSEEN.&rsquo; In virtuous and calm
      resolution it appears,&mdash;ay, I behold it now; there, there, with its
      livid eyes!&rdquo;&mdash;and the drops fell from his brow. &ldquo;But it shall no
      longer daunt me from that resolution. I face it, and it gradually darkens
      back into the shade.&rdquo; He paused, and his eyes dwelt with a terrible
      exultation upon the sunlit space; then, with a heavy and deep-drawn
      breath, he resumed, &ldquo;Viola, I have found the means of escape. We will
      leave this city. In some other land we will endeavour to comfort each
      other, and forget the past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Viola, calmly; &ldquo;I have no further wish to stir, till I am born
      hence to the last resting-place. I dreamed of him last night, Clarence!&mdash;dreamed
      of him for the first time since we parted; and, do not mock me, methought
      that he forgave the deserter, and called me &lsquo;Wife.&rsquo; That dream hallows the
      room. Perhaps it will visit me again before I die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk not of him,&mdash;of the demi-fiend!&rdquo; cried Glyndon, fiercely, and
      stamping his foot. &ldquo;Thank the Heavens for any fate that hath rescued thee
      from him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Viola, gravely. And as she was about to proceed, her eye fell
      upon the child. It was standing in the very centre of that slanting column
      of light which the sun poured into the chamber; and the rays seemed to
      surround it as a halo, and settled, crown-like, on the gold of its shining
      hair. In its small shape, so exquisitely modelled, in its large, steady,
      tranquil eyes, there was something that awed, while it charmed the
      mother&rsquo;s pride. It gazed on Glyndon as he spoke, with a look which almost
      might have seemed disdain, and which Viola, at least, interpreted as a
      defence of the Absent, stronger than her own lips could frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon broke the pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou wouldst stay, for what? To betray a mother&rsquo;s duty! If any evil
      happen to thee here, what becomes of thine infant? Shall it be brought up
      an orphan, in a country that has desecrated thy religion, and where human
      charity exists no more? Ah, weep, and clasp it to thy bosom; but tears do
      not protect and save.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hast conquered, my friend, I will fly with thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow night, then, be prepared. I will bring thee the necessary
      disguises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Glyndon then proceeded to sketch rapidly the outline of the path they
      were to take, and the story they were to tell. Viola listened, but
      scarcely comprehended; he pressed her hand to his heart and departed.

    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Van seco pur anco
     Sdegno ed Amor, quasi due Veltri al fianco.
     &ldquo;Ger. Lib.&rdquo; cant. xx. cxvii.

     (There went with him still Disdain and Love, like two greyhounds
     side by side.)
</pre>
    <p>
      Glyndon did not perceive, as he hurried from the house, two forms
      crouching by the angle of the wall. He saw still the spectre gliding by
      his side; but he beheld not the yet more poisonous eyes of human envy and
      woman&rsquo;s jealousy that glared on his retreating footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicot advanced to the house; Fillide followed him in silence. The painter,
      an old sans-culotte, knew well what language to assume to the porter. He
      beckoned the latter from his lodge, &ldquo;How is this, citizen? Thou harbourest
      a &lsquo;suspect.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Citizen, you terrify me!&mdash;if so, name him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a man; a refugee, an Italian woman, lodges here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, au troisieme,&mdash;the door to the left. But what of her?&mdash;she
      cannot be dangerous, poor child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Citizen, beware! Dost thou dare to pity her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? No, no, indeed. But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak the truth! Who visits her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one but an Englishman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is it,&mdash;an Englishman, a spy of Pitt and Coburg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just Heaven! is it possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, citizen! dost thou speak of Heaven? Thou must be an aristocrat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed; it was but an old bad habit, and escaped me unawares.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How often does the Englishman visit her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fillide uttered an exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She never stirs out,&rdquo; said the porter. &ldquo;Her sole occupations are in work,
      and care of her infant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her infant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fillide made a bound forward. Nicot in vain endeavoured to arrest her. She
      sprang up the stairs; she paused not till she was before the door
      indicated by the porter; it stood ajar, she entered, she stood at the
      threshold, and beheld that face, still so lovely! The sight of so much
      beauty left her hopeless. And the child, over whom the mother bent!&mdash;she
      who had never been a mother!&mdash;she uttered no sound; the furies were
      at work within her breast. Viola turned, and saw her, and, terrified by
      the strange apparition, with features that expressed the deadliest hate
      and scorn and vengeance, uttered a cry, and snatched the child to her
      bosom. The Italian laughed aloud,&mdash;turned, descended, and, gaining
      the spot where Nicot still conversed with the frightened porter drew him
      from the house. When they were in the open street, she halted abruptly,
      and said, &ldquo;Avenge me, and name thy price!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My price, sweet one! is but permission to love thee. Thou wilt fly with
      me to-morrow night; thou wilt possess thyself of the passports and the
      plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall, before then, find their asylum in the Conciergerie. The guillotine
      shall requite thy wrongs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do this, and I am satisfied,&rdquo; said Fillide, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they spoke no more till they regained the house. But when she there,
      looking up to the dull building, saw the windows of the room which the
      belief of Glyndon&rsquo;s love had once made a paradise, the tiger relented at
      the heart; something of the woman gushed back upon her nature, dark and
      savage as it was. She pressed the arm on which she leaned convulsively,
      and exclaimed, &ldquo;No, no! not him! denounce her,&mdash;let her perish; but I
      have slept on HIS bosom,&mdash;not HIM!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be as thou wilt,&rdquo; said Nicot, with a devil&rsquo;s sneer; &ldquo;but he must
      be arrested for the moment. No harm shall happen to him, for no accuser
      shall appear. But her,&mdash;thou wilt not relent for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fillide turned upon him her eyes, and their dark glance was sufficient
      answer.

      CHAPTER 7.VI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     In poppa quella
     Che guidar gli dovea, fatal Donsella.
     &ldquo;Ger. Lib.&rdquo; cant. xv. 3.

     (By the prow was the fatal lady ordained to be the guide.)
</pre>
    <p>
      The Italian did not overrate that craft of simulation proverbial with her
      country and her sex. Not a word, not a look, that day revealed to Glyndon
      the deadly change that had converted devotion into hate. He himself,
      indeed, absorbed in his own schemes, and in reflections on his own strange
      destiny, was no nice observer. But her manner, milder and more subdued
      than usual, produced a softening effect upon his meditations towards the
      evening; and he then began to converse with her on the certain hope of
      escape, and on the future that would await them in less unhallowed lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thy fair friend,&rdquo; said Fillide, with an averted eye and a false
      smile, &ldquo;who was to be our companion?&mdash;thou hast resigned her, Nicot
      tells me, in favour of one in whom he is interested. Is it so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told thee this!&rdquo; returned Glyndon, evasively. &ldquo;Well! does the change
      content thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Traitor!&rdquo; muttered Fillide; and she rose suddenly, approached him, parted
      the long hair from his forehead caressingly, and pressed her lips
      convulsively on his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This were too fair a head for the doomsman,&rdquo; said she, with a slight
      laugh, and, turning away, appeared occupied in preparations for their
      departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, when he rose, Glyndon did not see the Italian; she was
      absent from the house when he left it. It was necessary that he should
      once more visit C&mdash; before his final Departure, not only to arrange
      for Nicot&rsquo;s participation in the flight, but lest any suspicion should
      have arisen to thwart or endanger the plan he had adopted. C&mdash;,
      though not one of the immediate coterie of Robespierre, and indeed
      secretly hostile to him, had possessed the art of keeping well with each
      faction as it rose to power. Sprung from the dregs of the populace, he
      had, nevertheless, the grace and vivacity so often found impartially
      amongst every class in France. He had contrived to enrich himself&mdash;none
      knew how&mdash;in the course of his rapid career. He became, indeed,
      ultimately one of the wealthiest proprietors of Paris, and at that time
      kept a splendid and hospitable mansion. He was one of those whom, from
      various reasons, Robespierre deigned to favour; and he had often saved the
      proscribed and suspected, by procuring them passports under disguised
      names, and advising their method of escape. But C&mdash; was a man who
      took this trouble only for the rich. &ldquo;The incorruptible Maximilien,&rdquo; who
      did not want the tyrant&rsquo;s faculty of penetration, probably saw through all
      his manoeuvres, and the avarice which he cloaked beneath his charity. But
      it was noticeable that Robespierre frequently seemed to wink at&mdash;nay,
      partially to encourage&mdash;such vice in men whom he meant hereafter to
      destroy, as would tend to lower them in the public estimation, and to
      contrast with his own austere and unassailable integrity and PURISM. And,
      doubtless, he often grimly smiled in his sleeve at the sumptuous mansion
      and the griping covetousness of the worthy Citizen C&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this personage, then, Glyndon musingly bent his way. It was true, as he
      had darkly said to Viola, that in proportion as he had resisted the
      spectre, its terrors had lost their influence. The time had come at last,
      when, seeing crime and vice in all their hideousness, and in so vast a
      theatre, he had found that in vice and crime there are deadlier horrors
      than in the eyes of a phantom-fear. His native nobleness began to return
      to him. As he passed the streets, he revolved in his mind projects of
      future repentance and reformation. He even meditated, as a just return for
      Fillide&rsquo;s devotion, the sacrifice of all the reasonings of his birth and
      education. He would repair whatever errors he had committed against her,
      by the self-immolation of marriage with one little congenial with himself.
      He who had once revolted from marriage with the noble and gentle Viola!&mdash;he
      had learned in that world of wrong to know that right is right, and that
      Heaven did not make the one sex to be the victim of the other. The young
      visions of the Beautiful and the Good rose once more before him; and along
      the dark ocean of his mind lay the smile of reawakening virtue, as a path
      of moonlight. Never, perhaps, had the condition of his soul been so
      elevated and unselfish.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile Jean Nicot, equally absorbed in dreams of the future, and
      already in his own mind laying out to the best advantage the gold of the
      friend he was about to betray, took his way to the house honoured by the
      residence of Robespierre. He had no intention to comply with the relenting
      prayer of Fillide, that the life of Glyndon should be spared. He thought
      with Barrere, &ldquo;Il n&rsquo;y a que les morts qui ne revient pas.&rdquo; In all men who
      have devoted themselves to any study, or any art, with sufficient pains to
      attain a certain degree of excellence, there must be a fund of energy
      immeasurably above that of the ordinary herd. Usually this energy is
      concentrated on the objects of their professional ambition, and leaves
      them, therefore, apathetic to the other pursuits of men. But where those
      objects are denied, where the stream has not its legitimate vent, the
      energy, irritated and aroused, possesses the whole being, and if not
      wasted on desultory schemes, or if not purified by conscience and
      principle, becomes a dangerous and destructive element in the social
      system, through which it wanders in riot and disorder. Hence, in all wise
      monarchies,&mdash;nay, in all well-constituted states,&mdash;the peculiar
      care with which channels are opened for every art and every science; hence
      the honour paid to their cultivators by subtle and thoughtful statesmen,
      who, perhaps, for themselves, see nothing in a picture but coloured
      canvas,&mdash;nothing in a problem but an ingenious puzzle. No state is
      ever more in danger than when the talent that should be consecrated to
      peace has no occupation but political intrigue or personal advancement.
      Talent unhonoured is talent at war with men. And here it is noticeable,
      that the class of actors having been the most degraded by the public
      opinion of the old regime, their very dust deprived of Christian burial,
      no men (with certain exceptions in the company especially favoured by the
      Court) were more relentless and revengeful among the scourges of the
      Revolution. In the savage Collot d&rsquo;Herbois, mauvais comedien, were
      embodied the wrongs and the vengeance of a class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the energy of Jean Nicot had never been sufficiently directed to the
      art he professed. Even in his earliest youth, the political disquisitions
      of his master, David, had distracted him from the more tedious labours of
      the easel. The defects of his person had embittered his mind; the atheism
      of his benefactor had deadened his conscience. For one great excellence of
      religion&mdash;above all, the Religion of the Cross&mdash;is, that it
      raises PATIENCE first into a virtue, and next into a hope. Take away the
      doctrine of another life, of requital hereafter, of the smile of a Father
      upon our sufferings and trials in our ordeal here, and what becomes of
      patience? But without patience, what is man?&mdash;and what a people?
      Without patience, art never can be high; without patience, liberty never
      can be perfected. By wild throes, and impetuous, aimless struggles,
      Intellect seeks to soar from Penury, and a nation to struggle into
      Freedom. And woe, thus unfortified, guideless, and unenduring,&mdash;woe
      to both!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicot was a villain as a boy. In most criminals, however abandoned, there
      are touches of humanity,&mdash;relics of virtue; and the true delineator
      of mankind often incurs the taunt of bad hearts and dull minds, for
      showing that even the worst alloy has some particles of gold, and even the
      best that come stamped from the mint of Nature have some adulteration of
      the dross. But there are exceptions, though few, to the general rule,&mdash;exceptions,
      when the conscience lies utterly dead, and when good or bad are things
      indifferent but as means to some selfish end. So was it with the protege
      of the atheist. Envy and hate filled up his whole being, and the
      consciousness of superior talent only made him curse the more all who
      passed him in the sunlight with a fairer form or happier fortunes. But,
      monster though he was, when his murderous fingers griped the throat of his
      benefactor, Time, and that ferment of all evil passions&mdash;the Reign of
      Blood&mdash;had made in the deep hell of his heart a deeper still. Unable
      to exercise his calling (for even had he dared to make his name prominent,
      revolutions are no season for painters; and no man&mdash;no! not the
      richest and proudest magnate of the land, has so great an interest in
      peace and order, has so high and essential a stake in the well being of
      society, as the poet and the artist), his whole intellect, ever restless
      and unguided, was left to ponder over the images of guilt most congenial
      to it. He had no future but in this life; and how in this life had the men
      of power around him, the great wrestlers for dominion, thriven? All that
      was good, pure, unselfish,&mdash;whether among Royalists or Republicans,&mdash;swept
      to the shambles, and the deathsmen left alone in the pomp and purple of
      their victims! Nobler paupers than Jean Nicot would despair; and Poverty
      would rise in its ghastly multitudes to cut the throat of Wealth, and then
      gash itself limb by limb, if Patience, the Angel of the Poor, sat not by
      its side, pointing with solemn finger to the life to come! And now, as
      Nicot neared the house of the Dictator, he began to meditate a reversal of
      his plans of the previous day: not that he faltered in his resolution to
      denounce Glyndon, and Viola would necessarily share his fate, as a
      companion and accomplice,&mdash;no, THERE he was resolved! for he hated
      both (to say nothing of his old but never-to-be-forgotten grudge against
      Zanoni). Viola had scorned him, Glyndon had served, and the thought of
      gratitude was as intolerable to him as the memory of insult. But why, now,
      should he fly from France?&mdash;he could possess himself of Glyndon&rsquo;s
      gold; he doubted not that he could so master Fillide by her wrath and
      jealousy that he could command her acquiescence in all he proposed. The
      papers he had purloined&mdash;Desmoulins&rsquo; correspondence with Glyndon&mdash;while
      it insured the fate of the latter, might be eminently serviceable to
      Robespierre, might induce the tyrant to forget his own old liaisons with
      Hebert, and enlist him among the allies and tools of the King of Terror.
      Hopes of advancement, of wealth, of a career, again rose before him. This
      correspondence, dated shortly before Camille Desmoulins&rsquo; death, was
      written with that careless and daring imprudence which characterised the
      spoiled child of Danton. It spoke openly of designs against Robespierre;
      it named confederates whom the tyrant desired only a popular pretext to
      crush. It was a new instrument of death in the hands of the
      Death-compeller. What greater gift could he bestow on Maximilien the
      Incorruptible?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nursing these thoughts, he arrived at last before the door of Citizen
      Dupleix. Around the threshold were grouped, in admired confusion, some
      eight or ten sturdy Jacobins, the voluntary body-guard of Robespierre,&mdash;tall
      fellows, well armed, and insolent with the power that reflects power,
      mingled with women, young and fair, and gayly dressed, who had come, upon
      the rumour that Maximilien had had an attack of bile, to inquire tenderly
      of his health; for Robespierre, strange though it seem, was the idol of
      the sex!
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this cortege stationed without the door, and reaching up the
      stairs to the landing-place,&mdash;for Robespierre&rsquo;s apartments were not
      spacious enough to afford sufficient antechamber for levees so numerous
      and miscellaneous,&mdash;Nicot forced his way; and far from friendly or
      flattering were the expressions that regaled his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha, le joli Polichinelle!&rdquo; said a comely matron, whose robe his
      obtrusive and angular elbows cruelly discomposed. &ldquo;But how could one
      expect gallantry from such a scarecrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Citizen, I beg to advise thee (The courteous use of the plural was
      proscribed at Paris. The Societies Populaires had decided that whoever
      used it should be prosecuted as suspect et adulateur! At the door of the
      public administrations and popular societies was written up, &ldquo;Ici on
      s&rsquo;honore du Citoyen, et on se tutoye&rdquo;!!! (&ldquo;Here they respect the title of
      Citizen, and they &lsquo;thee&rsquo; and &lsquo;thou&rsquo; one another.&rdquo;) Take away Murder from
      the French Revolution and it becomes the greatest farce ever played before
      the angels!) that thou art treading on my feet. I beg thy pardon, but now
      I look at thine, I see the hall is not wide enough for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! Citizen Nicot,&rdquo; cried a Jacobin, shouldering his formidable bludgeon,
      &ldquo;and what brings thee hither?&mdash;thinkest thou that Hebert&rsquo;s crimes are
      forgotten already? Off, sport of Nature! and thank the Etre Supreme that
      he made thee insignificant enough to be forgiven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty face to look out of the National Window&rdquo; (The Guillotine.), said
      the woman whose robe the painter had ruffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Citizens,&rdquo; said Nicot, white with passion, but constraining himself so
      that his words seemed to come from grinded teeth, &ldquo;I have the honour to
      inform you that I seek the Representant upon business of the utmost
      importance to the public and himself; and,&rdquo; he added slowly and
      malignantly, glaring round, &ldquo;I call all good citizens to be my witnesses
      when I shall complain to Robespierre of the reception bestowed on me by
      some amongst you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was in the man&rsquo;s look and his tone of voice so much of deep and
      concentrated malignity, that the idlers drew back, and as the remembrance
      of the sudden ups and downs of revolutionary life occurred to them,
      several voices were lifted to assure the squalid and ragged painter that
      nothing was farther from their thoughts than to offer affront to a citizen
      whose very appearance proved him to be an exemplary sans-culotte. Nicot
      received these apologies in sullen silence, and, folding his arms, leaned
      against the wall, waiting in grim patience for his admission.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loiterers talked to each other in separate knots of two and three; and
      through the general hum rang the clear, loud, careless whistle of the tall
      Jacobin who stood guard by the stairs. Next to Nicot, an old woman and a
      young virgin were muttering in earnest whispers, and the atheist painter
      chuckled inly to overhear their discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure thee, my dear,&rdquo; said the crone, with a mysterious shake of head,
      &ldquo;that the divine Catherine Theot, whom the impious now persecute, is
      really inspired. There can be no doubt that the elect, of whom Dom Gerle
      and the virtuous Robespierre are destined to be the two grand prophets,
      will enjoy eternal life here, and exterminate all their enemies. There is
      no doubt of it,&mdash;not the least!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How delightful!&rdquo; said the girl; &ldquo;ce cher Robespierre!&mdash;he does not
      look very long-lived either!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The greater the miracle,&rdquo; said the old woman. &ldquo;I am just eighty-one, and
      I don&rsquo;t feel a day older since Catherine Theot promised me I should be one
      of the elect!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the women were jostled aside by some newcomers, who talked loud and
      eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried a brawny man, whose garb denoted him to be a butcher, with
      bare arms, and a cap of liberty on his head; &ldquo;I am come to warn
      Robespierre. They lay a snare for him; they offer him the Palais National.
      &lsquo;On ne peut etre ami du peuple et habiter un palais.&rsquo;&rdquo; (&ldquo;No one can be a
      friend of the people, and dwell in a palace.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Papiers inedits
      trouves chez Robespierre,&rdquo; etc., volume ii. page 132.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; answered a cordonnier; &ldquo;I like him best in his little
      lodging with the menuisier: it looks like one of US.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another rush of the crowd, and a new group were thrown forward in the
      vicinity of Nicot. And these men gabbled and chattered faster and louder
      than the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my plan is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Au diable with YOUR plan! I tell you MY scheme is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cried a third. &ldquo;When Robespierre understands MY new method of
      making gunpowder, the enemies of France shall&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! who fears foreign enemies?&rdquo; interrupted a fourth; &ldquo;the enemies to be
      feared are at home. MY new guillotine takes off fifty heads at a time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But MY new Constitution!&rdquo; exclaimed a fifth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY new Religion, citizen!&rdquo; murmured, complacently, a sixth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sacre mille tonnerres, silence!&rdquo; roared forth one of the Jacobin guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the crowd suddenly parted as a fierce-looking man, buttoned up to the
      chin, his sword rattling by his side, his spurs clinking at his heel,
      descended the stairs,&mdash;his cheeks swollen and purple with
      intemperance, his eyes dead and savage as a vulture&rsquo;s. There was a still
      pause, as all, with pale cheeks, made way for the relentless Henriot. (Or
      H<i>a</i>nriot. It is singular how undetermined are not only the
      characters of the French Revolution, but even the spelling of their names.
      With the historians it is Vergniau<i>d</i>,&mdash;with the journalists of
      the time it is Vorgniau<i>x</i>. With one authority it is Robespierre,&mdash;with
      another Robe<i>r</i>spierre.) Scarce had this gruff and iron minion of the
      tyrant stalked through the throng, than a new movement of respect and
      agitation and fear swayed the increasing crowd, as there glided in, with
      the noiselessness of a shadow, a smiling, sober citizen, plainly but
      neatly clad, with a downcast humble eye. A milder, meeker face no pastoral
      poet could assign to Corydon or Thyrsis,&mdash;why did the crowd shrink
      and hold their breath? As the ferret in a burrow crept that slight form
      amongst the larger and rougher creatures that huddled and pressed back on
      each other as he passed. A wink of his stealthy eye, and the huge Jacobins
      left the passage clear, without sound or question. On he went to the
      apartment of the tyrant, and thither will we follow him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 7.VII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Constitutum est, ut quisquis eum HOMINEM dixisset fuisse,
     capitalem penderet poenam.
     &mdash;St. Augustine, &ldquo;Of the God Serapis,&rdquo; l. 18, &ldquo;de Civ. Dei,&rdquo; c. 5.

     (It was decreed, that whoso should say that he had been a MAN,
     should suffer the punishment of a capital offence.)
</pre>
    <p>
      Robespierre was reclining languidly in his fauteuil, his cadaverous
      countenance more jaded and fatigued than usual. He to whom Catherine Theot
      assured immortal life, looked, indeed, like a man at death&rsquo;s door. On the
      table before him was a dish heaped with oranges, with the juice of which
      it is said that he could alone assuage the acrid bile that overflowed his
      system; and an old woman, richly dressed (she had been a Marquise in the
      old regime) was employed in peeling the Hesperian fruits for the sick
      Dragon, with delicate fingers covered with jewels. I have before said that
      Robespierre was the idol of the women. Strange certainly!&mdash;but then
      they were French women! The old Marquise, who, like Catherine Theot,
      called him &ldquo;son,&rdquo; really seemed to love him piously and disinterestedly as
      a mother; and as she peeled the oranges, and heaped on him the most
      caressing and soothing expressions, the livid ghost of a smile fluttered
      about his meagre lips. At a distance, Payan and Couthon, seated at another
      table, were writing rapidly, and occasionally pausing from their work to
      consult with each other in brief whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly one of the Jacobins opened the door, and, approaching
      Robespierre, whispered to him the name of Guerin. (See for the espionage
      on which Guerin was employed, &ldquo;Les Papiers inedits,&rdquo; etc., volume i. page
      366, No. xxviii.) At that word the sick man started up, as if new life
      were in the sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My kind friend,&rdquo; he said to the Marquise, &ldquo;forgive me; I must dispense
      with thy tender cares. France demands me. I am never ill when I can serve
      my country!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old Marquise lifted up her eyes to heaven and murmured, &ldquo;Quel ange!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robespierre waved his hand impatiently; and the old woman, with a sigh,
      patted his pale cheek, kissed his forehead, and submissively withdrew. The
      next moment, the smiling, sober man we have before described, stood,
      bending low, before the tyrant. And well might Robespierre welcome one of
      the subtlest agents of his power,&mdash;one on whom he relied more than
      the clubs of his Jacobins, the tongues of his orators, the bayonets of his
      armies; Guerin, the most renowned of his ecouteurs,&mdash;the searching,
      prying, universal, omnipresent spy, who glided like a sunbeam through
      chink and crevice, and brought to him intelligence not only of the deeds,
      but the hearts of men!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, citizen, well!&mdash;and what of Tallien?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning, early, two minutes after eight, he went out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So early?&mdash;hem!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He passed Rue des Quatre Fils, Rue de Temple, Rue de la Reunion, au
      Marais, Rue Martin; nothing observable, except that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He amused himself at a stall in bargaining for some books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bargaining for books! Aha, the charlatan!&mdash;he would cloak the
      intriguant under the savant! Well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last, in the Rue des Fosses Montmartre, an individual in a blue
      surtout (unknown) accosted him. They walked together about the street some
      minutes, and were joined by Legendre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Legendre! approach, Payan! Legendre, thou hearest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went into a fruit-stall, and hired two little girls to go and play at
      ball within hearing. They heard Legendre say, &lsquo;I believe his power is
      wearing itself out.&rsquo; And Tallien answered, &lsquo;And HIMSELF too. I would not
      give three months&rsquo; purchase for his life.&rsquo; I do not know, citizen, if they
      meant THEE?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I, citizen,&rdquo; answered Robespierre, with a fell smile, succeeded by an
      expression of gloomy thought. &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;I am young yet,&mdash;in
      the prime of life. I commit no excess. No; my constitution is sound,
      sound. Anything farther of Tallien?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The woman whom he loves&mdash;Teresa de Fontenai&mdash;who lies in
      prison, still continues to correspond with him; to urge him to save her by
      thy destruction: this my listeners overheard. His servant is the messenger
      between the prisoner and himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So! The servant shall be seized in the open streets of Paris. The Reign
      of Terror is not over yet. With the letters found on him, if such their
      context, I will pluck Tallien from his benches in the Convention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robespierre rose, and after walking a few moments to and fro the room in
      thought, opened the door and summoned one of the Jacobins without. To him
      he gave his orders for the watch and arrest of Tallien&rsquo;s servant, and then
      threw himself again into his chair. As the Jacobin departed, Guerin
      whispered,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not that the Citizen Aristides?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; a faithful fellow, if he would wash himself, and not swear so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didst thou not guillotine his brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Aristides denounced him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, are such men safe about thy person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! that is true.&rdquo; And Robespierre, drawing out his pocketbook, wrote
      a memorandum in it, replaced it in his vest, and resumed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else of Tallien?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more. He and Legendre, with the unknown, walked to the Jardin
      Egalite, and there parted. I saw Tallien to his house. But I have other
      news. Thou badest me watch for those who threaten thee in secret letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guerin! hast thou detected them? Hast thou&mdash;hast thou&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the tyrant, as he spoke, opened and shut both his hands, as if already
      grasping the lives of the writers, and one of those convulsive grimaces
      that seemed like an epileptic affection, to which he was subject,
      distorted his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Citizen, I think I have found one. Thou must know that amongst those most
      disaffected is the painter Nicot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, stay!&rdquo; said Robespierre, opening a manuscript book, bound in red
      morocco (for Robespierre was neat and precise, even in his death-lists),
      and turning to an alphabetical index,&mdash;&ldquo;Nicot!&mdash;I have him,&mdash;atheist,
      sans-culotte (I hate slovens), friend of Hebert! Aha! N.B.&mdash;Rene
      Dumas knows of his early career and crimes. Proceed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Nicot has been suspected of diffusing tracts and pamphlets against
      thyself and the Comite. Yesterday evening, when he was out, his porter
      admitted me into his apartment, Rue Beau Repaire. With my master-key I
      opened his desk and escritoire. I found herein a drawing of thyself at the
      guillotine; and underneath was written, &lsquo;Bourreau de ton pays, lis l&rsquo;arret
      de ton chatiment!&rsquo; (Executioner of thy country, read the decree of thy
      punishment!) I compared the words with the fragments of the various
      letters thou gavest me: the handwriting tallies with one. See, I tore off
      the writing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robespierre looked, smiled, and, as if his vengeance were already
      satisfied, threw himself on his chair. &ldquo;It is well! I feared it was a more
      powerful enemy. This man must be arrested at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he waits below. I brushed by him as I ascended the stairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he so?&mdash;admit!&mdash;nay,&mdash;hold! hold! Guerin, withdraw
      into the inner chamber till I summon thee again. Dear Payan, see that this
      Nicot conceals no weapons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Payan, who was as brave as Robespierre was pusillanimous, repressed the
      smile of disdain that quivered on his lips a moment, and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Robespierre, with his head buried in his bosom, seemed plunged
      in deep thought. &ldquo;Life is a melancholy thing, Couthon!&rdquo; said he, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begging your pardon, I think death worse,&rdquo; answered the philanthropist,
      gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robespierre made no rejoinder, but took from his portefeuille that
      singular letter, which was found afterwards amongst his papers, and is
      marked LXI. in the published collection. (&ldquo;Papiers inedits,&rsquo; etc., volume
      ii. page 156.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without doubt,&rdquo; it began, &ldquo;you are uneasy at not having earlier received
      news from me. Be not alarmed; you know that I ought only to reply by our
      ordinary courier; and as he has been interrupted, dans sa derniere course,
      that is the cause of my delay. When you receive this, employ all diligence
      to fly a theatre where you are about to appear and disappear for the last
      time. It were idle to recall to you all the reasons that expose you to
      peril. The last step that should place you sur le sopha de la presidence,
      but brings you to the scaffold; and the mob will spit on your face as it
      has spat on those whom you have judged. Since, then, you have accumulated
      here a sufficient treasure for existence, I await you with great
      impatience, to laugh with you at the part you have played in the troubles
      of a nation as credulous as it is avid of novelties. Take your part
      according to our arrangements,&mdash;all is prepared. I conclude,&mdash;our
      courier waits. I expect your reply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Musingly and slowly the Dictator devoured the contents of this epistle.
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said to himself,&mdash;&ldquo;no; he who has tasted power can no longer
      enjoy repose. Yet, Danton, Danton! thou wert right; better to be a poor
      fisherman than to govern men.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Il vaudrait mieux,&rdquo; said Danton, in his
      dungeon, &ldquo;etre un pauvre pecheur que de gouverner les hommes.&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, and Payan reappeared and whispered Robespierre, &ldquo;All is
      safe! See the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Dictator, satisfied, summoned his attendant Jacobin to conduct Nicot
      to his presence. The painter entered with a fearless expression in his
      deformed features, and stood erect before Robespierre, who scanned him
      with a sidelong eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is remarkable that most of the principal actors of the Revolution were
      singularly hideous in appearance,&mdash;from the colossal ugliness of
      Mirabeau and Danton, or the villanous ferocity in the countenances of
      David and Simon, to the filthy squalor of Marat, the sinister and bilious
      meanness of the Dictator&rsquo;s features. But Robespierre, who was said to
      resemble a cat, had also a cat&rsquo;s cleanness; and his prim and dainty dress,
      his shaven smoothness, the womanly whiteness of his lean hands, made yet
      more remarkable the disorderly ruffianism that characterised the attire
      and mien of the painter-sans-culotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, citizen,&rdquo; said Robespierre, mildly, &ldquo;thou wouldst speak with me?
      I know thy merits and civism have been overlooked too long. Thou wouldst
      ask some suitable provision in the state? Scruple not&mdash;say on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Virtuous Robespierre, toi qui eclaires l&rsquo;univers (Thou who enlightenest
      the world.), I come not to ask a favour, but to render service to the
      state. I have discovered a correspondence that lays open a conspiracy of
      which many of the actors are yet unsuspected.&rdquo; And he placed the papers on
      the table. Robespierre seized, and ran his eye over them rapidly and
      eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&mdash;good!&rdquo; he muttered to himself: &ldquo;this is all I wanted.
      Barrere, Legendre! I have them! Camille Desmoulins was but their dupe. I
      loved him once; I never loved them! Citizen Nicot, I thank thee. I observe
      these letters are addressed to an Englishman. What Frenchman but must
      distrust these English wolves in sheep&rsquo;s clothing! France wants no longer
      citizens of the world; that farce ended with Anarcharsis Clootz. I beg
      pardon, Citizen Nicot; but Clootz and Hebert were THY friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Nicot, apologetically, &ldquo;we are all liable to be deceived. I
      ceased to honour them whom thou didst declare against; for I disown my own
      senses rather than thy justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I pretend to justice; that IS the virtue I affect,&rdquo; said
      Robespierre, meekly; and with his feline propensities he enjoyed, even in
      that critical hour of vast schemes, of imminent danger, of meditated
      revenge, the pleasure of playing with a solitary victim. (The most
      detestable anecdote of this peculiar hypocrisy in Robespierre is that in
      which he is recorded to have tenderly pressed the hand of his old
      school-friend, Camille Desmoulins, the day that he signed the warrant for
      his arrest.) &ldquo;And my justice shall no longer be blind to thy services,
      good Nicot. Thou knowest this Glyndon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, well,&mdash;intimately. He WAS my friend, but I would give up my
      brother if he were one of the &lsquo;indulgents.&rsquo; I am not ashamed to say that I
      have received favours from this man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha!&mdash;and thou dost honestly hold the doctrine that where a man
      threatens my life all personal favours are to be forgotten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good citizen!&mdash;kind Nicot!&mdash;oblige me by writing the address of
      this Glyndon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nicot stooped to the table; and suddenly when the pen was in his hand, a
      thought flashed across him, and he paused, embarrassed and confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write on, KIND Nicot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painter slowly obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are the other familiars of Glyndon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was on that point I was about to speak to thee, Representant,&rdquo; said
      Nicot. &ldquo;He visits daily a woman, a foreigner, who knows all his secrets;
      she affects to be poor, and to support her child by industry. But she is
      the wife of an Italian of immense wealth, and there is no doubt that she
      has moneys which are spent in corrupting the citizens. She should be
      seized and arrested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write down her name also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no time is to be lost; for I know that both have a design to escape
      from Paris this very night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our government is prompt, good Nicot,&mdash;never fear. Humph!&mdash;humph!&rdquo;
       and Robespierre took the paper on which Nicot had written, and stooping
      over it&mdash;for he was near-sighted&mdash;added, smilingly, &ldquo;Dost thou
      always write the same hand, citizen? This seems almost like a disguised
      character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not like them to know who denounced them, Representant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! good! Thy virtue shall be rewarded, trust me. Salut et fraternite!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robespierre half rose as he spoke, and Nicot withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho, there!&mdash;without!&rdquo; cried the Dictator, ringing his bell; and as
      the ready Jacobin attended the summons, &ldquo;Follow that man, Jean Nicot. The
      instant he has cleared the house seize him. At once to the Conciergerie
      with him. Stay!&mdash;nothing against the law; there is thy warrant. The
      public accuser shall have my instruction. Away!&mdash;quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Jacobin vanished. All trace of illness, of infirmity, had gone from
      the valetudinarian; he stood erect on the floor, his face twitching
      convulsively, and his arms folded. &ldquo;Ho! Guerin!&rdquo; the spy reappeared&mdash;&ldquo;take
      these addresses! Within an hour this Englishman and his woman must be in
      prison; their revelations will aid me against worthier foes. They shall
      die: they shall perish with the rest on the 10th,&mdash;the third day from
      this. There!&rdquo; and he wrote hastily,&mdash;&ldquo;there, also, is thy warrant!
      Off!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Couthon, Payan, we will dally no longer with Tallien and his
      crew. I have information that the Convention will NOT attend the Fete on
      the 10th. We must trust only to the sword of the law. I must compose my
      thoughts,&mdash;prepare my harangue. To-morrow, I will reappear at the
      Convention; to-morrow, bold St. Just joins us, fresh from our victorious
      armies; to-morrow, from the tribune, I will dart the thunderbolt on the
      masked enemies of France; to-morrow, I will demand, in the face of the
      country, the heads of the conspirators.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER 7.VIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Le glaive est contre toi tourne de toutes parties.
     La Harpe, &ldquo;Jeanne de Naples,&rdquo; Act iv. sc. 4.

     (The sword is raised against you on all sides.)
</pre>
    <p>
      In the mean time Glyndon, after an audience of some length with C&mdash;,
      in which the final preparations were arranged, sanguine of safety, and
      foreseeing no obstacle to escape, bent his way back to Fillide. Suddenly,
      in the midst of his cheerful thoughts, he fancied he heard a voice too
      well and too terribly recognised, hissing in his ear, &ldquo;What! thou wouldst
      defy and escape me! thou wouldst go back to virtue and content. It is in
      vain,&mdash;it is too late. No, <i>I</i> will not haunt thee; HUMAN
      footsteps, no less inexorable, dog thee now. Me thou shalt not see again
      till in the dungeon, at midnight, before thy doom! Behold&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Glyndon, mechanically turning his head, saw, close behind him, the
      stealthy figure of a man whom he had observed before, but with little
      heed, pass and repass him, as he quitted the house of Citizen C&mdash;.
      Instantly and instinctively he knew that he was watched,&mdash;that he was
      pursued. The street he was in was obscure and deserted, for the day was
      oppressively sultry, and it was the hour when few were abroad, either on
      business or pleasure. Bold as he was, an icy chill shot through his heart,
      he knew too well the tremendous system that then reigned in Paris not to
      be aware of his danger. As the sight of the first plague-boil to the
      victim of the pestilence, was the first sight of the shadowy spy to that
      of the Revolution: the watch, the arrest, the trial, the guillotine,&mdash;these
      made the regular and rapid steps of the monster that the anarchists called
      Law! He breathed hard, he heard distinctly the loud beating of his heart.
      And so he paused, still and motionless, gazing upon the shadow that halted
      also behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, the absence of all allies to the spy, the solitude of the
      streets, reanimated his courage; he made a step towards his pursuer, who
      retreated as he advanced. &ldquo;Citizen, thou followest me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Thy
      business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; answered the man, with a deprecating smile, &ldquo;the streets are
      broad enough for both? Thou art not so bad a republican as to arrogate all
      Paris to thyself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on first, then. I make way for thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man bowed, doffed his hat politely, and passed forward. The next
      moment Glyndon plunged into a winding lane, and fled fast through a
      labyrinth of streets, passages, and alleys. By degrees he composed
      himself, and, looking behind, imagined that he had baffled the pursuer; he
      then, by a circuitous route, bent his way once more to his home. As he
      emerged into one of the broader streets, a passenger, wrapped in a mantle,
      brushing so quickly by him that he did not observe his countenance,
      whispered, &ldquo;Clarence Glyndon, you are dogged,&mdash;follow me!&rdquo; and the
      stranger walked quickly before him. Clarence turned, and sickened once
      more to see at his heels, with the same servile smile on his face, the
      pursuer he fancied he had escaped. He forgot the injunction of the
      stranger to follow him, and perceiving a crowd gathered close at hand,
      round a caricature-shop, dived amidst them, and, gaining another street,
      altered the direction he had before taken, and, after a long and
      breathless course, gained without once more seeing the spy, a distant
      quartier of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, indeed, all seemed so serene and fair that his artist eye, even in
      that imminent hour, rested with pleasure on the scene. It was a
      comparatively broad space, formed by one of the noble quays. The Seine
      flowed majestically along, with boats and craft resting on its surface.
      The sun gilt a thousand spires and domes, and gleamed on the white palaces
      of a fallen chivalry. Here fatigued and panting, he paused an instant, and
      a cooler air from the river fanned his brow. &ldquo;Awhile, at least, I am safe
      here,&rdquo; he murmured; and as he spoke, some thirty paces behind him, he
      beheld the spy. He stood rooted to the spot; wearied and spent as he was,
      escape seemed no longer possible,&mdash;the river on one side (no bridge
      at hand), and the long row of mansions closing up the other. As he halted,
      he heard laughter and obscene songs from a house a little in his rear,
      between himself and the spy. It was a cafe fearfully known in that
      quarter. Hither often resorted the black troop of Henriot,&mdash;the
      minions and huissiers of Robespierre. The spy, then, had hunted the victim
      within the jaws of the hounds. The man slowly advanced, and, pausing
      before the open window of the cafe, put his head through the aperture, as
      to address and summon forth its armed inmates.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that very instant, and while the spy&rsquo;s head was thus turned from him,
      standing in the half-open gateway of the house immediately before him, he
      perceived the stranger who had warned; the figure, scarcely
      distinguishable through the mantle that wrapped it, motioned to him to
      enter. He sprang noiselessly through the friendly opening: the door
      closed; breathlessly he followed the stranger up a flight of broad stairs
      and through a suite of empty rooms, until, having gained a small cabinet,
      his conductor doffed the large hat and the long mantle that had hitherto
      concealed his shape and features, and Glyndon beheld Zanoni!

    <p>
      &ldquo;Far happier had it been if we had never met! Yet even in these last hours
      of my fate, I rejoice to look once more on the face of that ominous and
      mysterious being to whom I can ascribe all the sufferings I have known.
      Here, then, thou shalt not palter with or elude me. Here, before we part,
      thou shalt unravel to me the dark enigma, if not of thy life, of my own!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hast thou suffered? Poor neophyte!&rdquo; said Zanoni, pityingly. &ldquo;Yes; I see
      it on thy brow. But wherefore wouldst thou blame me? Did I not warn thee
      against the whispers of thy spirit; did I not warn thee to forbear? Did I
      not tell thee that the ordeal was one of awful hazard and tremendous
      fears,&mdash;nay, did I not offer to resign to thee the heart that was
      mighty enough, while mine, Glyndon, to content me? Was it not thine own
      daring and resolute choice to brave the initiation! Of thine own free will
      didst thou make Mejnour thy master, and his lore thy study!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But whence came the irresistible desires of that wild and unholy
      knowledge? I knew them not till thine evil eye fell upon me, and I was
      drawn into the magic atmosphere of thy being!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou errest!&mdash;the desires were in thee; and, whether in one
      direction or the other, would have forced their way! Man! thou askest me
      the enigma of thy fate and my own! Look round all being, is there not
      mystery everywhere? Can thine eye trace the ripening of the grain beneath
      the earth? In the moral and the physical world alike, lie dark portents,
      far more wondrous than the powers thou wouldst ascribe to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dost thou disown those powers; dost thou confess thyself an imposter?&mdash;or
      wilt thou dare to tell me that thou art indeed sold to the Evil one,&mdash;a
      magician whose familiar has haunted me night and day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It matters not what I am,&rdquo; returned Zanoni; &ldquo;it matters only whether I
      can aid thee to exorcise thy dismal phantom, and return once more to the
      wholesome air of this common life. Something, however, will I tell thee,
      not to vindicate myself, but the Heaven and the Nature that thy doubts
      malign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanoni paused a moment, and resumed with a slight smile,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In thy younger days thou hast doubtless read with delight the great
      Christian poet, whose muse, like the morning it celebrated, came to earth,
      &lsquo;crowned with flowers culled in Paradise.&rsquo; [&lsquo;L&rsquo;aurea testa Di rose colte
      in Paradiso infiora.&rsquo; Tasso, &ldquo;Ger. Lib.&rdquo; iv. l.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No spirit was more imbued with the knightly superstitions of the time;
      and surely the Poet of Jerusalem hath sufficiently, to satisfy even the
      Inquisitor he consulted, execrated all the practitioners of the unlawful
      spells invoked,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Per isforzar Cocito o Flegetonte.&rsquo; (To constrain Cocytus or Phlegethon.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in his sorrows and his wrongs, in the prison of his madhouse, know
      you not that Tasso himself found his solace, his escape, in the
      recognition of a holy and spiritual Theurgia,&mdash;of a magic that could
      summon the Angel, or the Good Genius, not the Fiend? And do you not
      remember how he, deeply versed as he was for his age, in the mysteries of
      the nobler Platonism, which hints at the secrets of all the starry
      brotherhoods, from the Chaldean to the later Rosicrucian, discriminates in
      his lovely verse, between the black art of Ismeno and the glorious lore of
      the Enchanter who counsels and guides upon their errand the champions of
      the Holy Land? HIS, not the charms wrought by the aid of the Stygian
      Rebels (See this remarkable passage, which does indeed not unfaithfully
      represent the doctrine of the Pythagorean and the Platonist, in Tasso,
      cant. xiv. stanzas xli. to xlvii. (&ldquo;Ger. Lib.&rdquo;) They are beautifully
      translated by Wiffen.), but the perception of the secret powers of the
      fountain and the herb,&mdash;the Arcana of the unknown nature and the
      various motions of the stars. His, the holy haunts of Lebanon and Carmel,&mdash;beneath
      his feet he saw the clouds, the snows, the hues of Iris, the generations
      of the rains and dews. Did the Christian Hermit who converted that
      Enchanter (no fabulous being, but the type of all spirit that would aspire
      through Nature up to God) command him to lay aside these sublime studies,
      &lsquo;Le solite arte e l&rsquo; uso mio&rsquo;? No! but to cherish and direct them to
      worthy ends. And in this grand conception of the poet lies the secret of
      the true Theurgia, which startles your ignorance in a more learned day
      with puerile apprehensions, and the nightmares of a sick man&rsquo;s dreams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Zanoni paused, and again resumed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In ages far remote,&mdash;of a civilisation far different from that which
      now merges the individual in the state,&mdash;there existed men of ardent
      minds, and an intense desire of knowledge. In the mighty and solemn
      kingdoms in which they dwelt, there were no turbulent and earthly channels
      to work off the fever of their minds. Set in the antique mould of casts
      through which no intellect could pierce, no valour could force its way,
      the thirst for wisdom alone reigned in the hearts of those who received
      its study as a heritage from sire to son. Hence, even in your imperfect
      records of the progress of human knowledge, you find that, in the earliest
      ages, Philosophy descended not to the business and homes of men. It dwelt
      amidst the wonders of the loftier creation; it sought to analyse the
      formation of matter,&mdash;the essentials of the prevailing soul; to read
      the mysteries of the starry orbs; to dive into those depths of Nature in
      which Zoroaster is said by the schoolmen first to have discovered the arts
      which your ignorance classes under the name of magic. In such an age,
      then, arose some men, who, amidst the vanities and delusions of their
      class, imagined that they detected gleams of a brighter and steadier lore.
      They fancied an affinity existing among all the works of Nature, and that
      in the lowliest lay the secret attraction that might conduct them upward
      to the loftiest. (Agreeably, it would seem, to the notion of Iamblichus
      and Plotinus, that the universe is as an animal; so that there is sympathy
      and communication between one part and the other; in the smallest part may
      be the subtlest nerve. And hence the universal magnetism of Nature. But
      man contemplates the universe as an animalcule would an elephant. The
      animalcule, seeing scarcely the tip of the hoof, would be incapable of
      comprehending that the trunk belonged to the same creature,&mdash;that the
      effect produced upon one extremity would be felt in an instant by the
      other.) Centuries passed, and lives were wasted in these discoveries; but
      step after step was chronicled and marked, and became the guide to the few
      who alone had the hereditary privilege to track their path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last from this dimness upon some eyes the light broke; but think not,
      young visionary, that to those who nursed unholy thoughts, over whom the
      Origin of Evil held a sway, that dawning was vouchsafed. It could be given
      then, as now, only to the purest ecstasies of imagination and intellect,
      undistracted by the cares of a vulgar life, or the appetites of the common
      clay. Far from descending to the assistance of a fiend, theirs was but the
      august ambition to approach nearer to the Fount of Good; the more they
      emancipated themselves from this limbo of the planets, the more they were
      penetrated by the splendour and beneficence of God. And if they sought,
      and at last discovered, how to the eye of the Spirit all the subtler
      modifications of being and of matter might be made apparent; if they
      discovered how, for the wings of the Spirit, all space might be
      annihilated, and while the body stood heavy and solid here, as a deserted
      tomb, the freed IDEA might wander from star to star,&mdash;if such
      discoveries became in truth their own, the sublimest luxury of their
      knowledge was but this, to wonder, to venerate, and adore! For, as one not
      unlearned in these high matters has expressed it, &lsquo;There is a principle of
      the soul superior to all external nature, and through this principle we
      are capable of surpassing the order and systems of the world, and
      participating the immortal life and the energy of the Sublime Celestials.
      When the soul is elevated to natures above itself, it deserts the order to
      which it is awhile compelled, and by a religious magnetism is attracted to
      another and a loftier, with which it blends and mingles.&rsquo; (From
      Iamblichus, &ldquo;On the Mysteries,&rdquo; c. 7, sect. 7.) Grant, then, that such
      beings found at last the secret to arrest death; to fascinate danger and
      the foe; to walk the revolutions of the earth unharmed,&mdash;think you
      that this life could teach them other desire than to yearn the more for
      the Immortal, and to fit their intellect the better for the higher being
      to which they might, when Time and Death exist no longer, be transferred?
      Away with your gloomy fantasies of sorcerer and demon!&mdash;the soul can
      aspire only to the light; and even the error of our lofty knowledge was
      but the forgetfulness of the weakness, the passions, and the bonds which
      the death we so vainly conquered only can purge away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This address was so different from what Glyndon had anticipated, that he
      remained for some moments speechless, and at length faltered out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why, then, to me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; added Zanoni,&mdash;&ldquo;why to thee have been only the penance and the
      terror,&mdash;the Threshold and the Phantom? Vain man! look to the
      commonest elements of the common learning. Can every tyro at his mere wish
      and will become the master; can the student, when he has bought his
      Euclid, become a Newton; can the youth whom the Muses haunt, say, &lsquo;I will
      equal Homer;&rsquo; yea, can yon pale tyrant, with all the parchment laws of a
      hundred system-shapers, and the pikes of his dauntless multitude, carve,
      at his will, a constitution not more vicious than the one which the
      madness of a mob could overthrow? When, in that far time to which I have
      referred, the student aspired to the heights to which thou wouldst have
      sprung at a single bound, he was trained from his very cradle to the
      career he was to run. The internal and the outward nature were made clear
      to his eyes, year after year, as they opened on the day. He was not
      admitted to the practical initiation till not one earthly wish chained
      that sublimest faculty which you call the IMAGINATION, one carnal desire
      clouded the penetrative essence that you call the INTELLECT. And even
      then, and at the best, how few attained to the last mystery! Happier
      inasmuch as they attained the earlier to the holy glories for which Death
      is the heavenliest gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanoni paused, and a shade of thought and sorrow darkened his celestial
      beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are there, indeed, others, besides thee and Mejnour, who lay claim to
      thine attributes, and have attained to thy secrets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Others there have been before us, but we two now are alone on earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imposter, thou betrayest thyself! If they could conquer Death, why live
      they not yet?&rdquo; (Glyndon appears to forget that Mejnour had before answered
      the very question which his doubts here a second time suggest.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child of a day!&rdquo; answered Zanoni, mournfully, &ldquo;have I not told thee the
      error of our knowledge was the forgetfulness of the desires and passions
      which the spirit never can wholly and permanently conquer while this
      matter cloaks it? Canst thou think that it is no sorrow, either to reject
      all human ties, all friendship, and all love, or to see, day after day,
      friendship and love wither from our life, as blossoms from the stem? Canst
      thou wonder how, with the power to live while the world shall last, ere
      even our ordinary date be finished we yet may prefer to die? Wonder rather
      that there are two who have clung so faithfully to earth! Me, I confess,
      that earth can enamour yet. Attaining to the last secret while youth was
      in its bloom, youth still colours all around me with its own luxuriant
      beauty; to me, yet, to breathe is to enjoy. The freshness has not faded
      from the face of Nature, and not an herb in which I cannot discover a new
      charm,&mdash;an undetected wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As with my youth, so with Mejnour&rsquo;s age: he will tell you that life to
      him is but a power to examine; and not till he has exhausted all the
      marvels which the Creator has sown on earth, would he desire new
      habitations for the renewed Spirit to explore. We are the types of the two
      essences of what is imperishable,&mdash;&lsquo;ART, that enjoys; and
      SCIENCE, that contemplates!&rsquo; And now, that thou mayest be contented that
      the secrets are not vouchsafed to thee, learn that so utterly must the
      idea detach itself from what makes up the occupation and excitement of
      men; so must it be void of whatever would covet, or love, or hate,&mdash;that
      for the ambitious man, for the lover, the hater, the power avails not. And
      I, at last, bound and blinded by the most common of household ties; I,
      darkened and helpless, adjure thee, the baffled and discontented,&mdash;I
      adjure thee to direct, to guide me; where are they? Oh, tell me,&mdash;speak!
      My wife,&mdash;my child? Silent!&mdash;oh, thou knowest now that I am no
      sorcerer, no enemy. I cannot give thee what thy faculties deny,&mdash;I
      cannot achieve what the passionless Mejnour failed to accomplish; but I
      can give thee the next-best boon, perhaps the fairest,&mdash;I can
      reconcile thee to the daily world, and place peace between thy conscience
      and thyself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilt thou promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By their sweet lives, I promise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glyndon looked and believed. He whispered the address to the house whither
      his fatal step already had brought woe and doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless thee for this,&rdquo; exclaimed Zanoni, passionately, &ldquo;and thou shalt be
      blessed! What! couldst thou not perceive that at the entrance to all the
      grander worlds dwell the race that intimidate and awe? Who in thy daily
      world ever left the old regions of Custom and Prescription, and felt not
      the first seizure of the shapeless and nameless Fear? Everywhere around
      thee where men aspire and labour, though they see it not,&mdash;in the
      closet of the sage, in the council of the demagogue, in the camp of the
      warrior,&mdash;everywhere cowers and darkens the Unutterable Horror. But
      there, where thou hast ventured, alone is the Phantom VISIBLE; and never
      will it cease to haunt, till thou canst pass to the Infinite, as the
      seraph; or return to the Familiar, as a child! But answer me this: when,
      seeking to adhere to some calm resolve of virtue, the Phantom hath stalked
      suddenly to thy side; when its voice hath whispered thee despair; when its
      ghastly eyes would scare thee back to those scenes of earthly craft or
      riotous excitement from which, as it leaves thee to worse foes to the
      soul, its presence is ever absent,&mdash;hast thou never bravely resisted
      the spectre and thine own horror; hast thou never said, &lsquo;Come what may, to
      Virtue I will cling?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; answered Glyndon, &ldquo;only of late have I dared to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thou hast felt then that the Phantom grew more dim and its power more
      faint?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rejoice, then!&mdash;thou hast overcome the true terror and mystery of
      the ordeal. Resolve is the first success. Rejoice, for the exorcism is
      sure! Thou art not of those who, denying a life to come, are the victims
      of the Inexorable Horror. Oh, when shall men learn, at last, that if the
      Great Religion inculcates so rigidly the necessity of FAITH, it is not
      alone that FAITH leads to the world to be; but that without faith there is
      no excellence in this,&mdash;faith in something wiser, happier, diviner,
      than we see on earth!&mdash;the artist calls it the Ideal,&mdash;the
      priest, Faith. The Ideal and Faith are one and the same. Return, O
      wanderer, return! Feel what beauty and holiness dwell in the Customary and
      the Old. Back to thy gateway glide, thou Horror! and calm, on the
      childlike heart, smile again, O azure Heaven, with thy night and thy
      morning star but as one, though under its double name of Memory and Hope!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he thus spoke, Zanoni laid his hand gently on the burning temples of
      his excited and wondering listener; and presently a sort of trance came
      over him: he imagined that he was returned to the home of his infancy;
      that he was in the small chamber where, over his early slumbers, his
      mother had watched and prayed. There it was,&mdash;visible, palpable,
      solitary, unaltered. In the recess, the homely bed; on the walls, the
      shelves filled with holy books; the very easel on which he had first
      sought to call the ideal to the canvas, dust-covered, broken, in the
      corner. Below the window lay the old churchyard: he saw it green in the
      distance, the sun glancing through the yew-trees; he saw the tomb where
      father and mother lay united, and the spire pointing up to heaven, the
      symbol of the hopes of those who consigned the ashes to the dust; in his
      ear rang the bells, pealing, as on a Sabbath day. Far fled all the visions
      of anxiety and awe that had haunted and convulsed; youth, boyhood,
      childhood came back to him with innocent desires and hopes; he thought he
      fell upon his knees to pray. He woke,&mdash;he woke in delicious tears, he
      felt that the Phantom was fled forever. He looked round,&mdash;Zanoni was
      gone. On the table lay these lines, the ink yet wet:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will find ways and means for thy escape. At nightfall, as the clock
      strikes nine, a boat shall wait thee on the river before this house; the
      boatman will guide thee to a retreat where thou mayst rest in safety till
      the Reign of Terror, which nears its close, be past. Think no more of the
      sensual love that lured, and wellnigh lost thee. It betrayed, and would
      have destroyed. Thou wilt regain thy land in safety,&mdash;long years yet
      spared to thee to muse over the past, and to redeem it. For thy future, be
      thy dream thy guide, and thy tears thy baptism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman obeyed the injunctions of the letter, and found their
      truth.

    <p>
      &ldquo;She is in one of their prisons,&mdash;their inexorable prisons. It is
      Robespierre&rsquo;s order,&mdash;I have tracked the cause to Glyndon. This,
      then, made that terrible connection between their fates which I could not
      unravel, but which (till severed as it now is) wrapped Glyndon himself in
      the same cloud that concealed her. In prison,&mdash;in prison!&mdash;it is
      the gate of the grave! Her trial, and the inevitable execution that
      follows such trial, is the third day from this. The tyrant has fixed all
      his schemes of slaughter for the 10th of Thermidor. While the deaths of
      the unoffending strike awe to the city, his satellites are to massacre his
      foes. There is but one hope left,&mdash;that the Power which now dooms the
      doomer, may render me an instrument to expedite his fall. But two days
      left,&mdash;two days! In all my wealth of time I see but two days; all
      beyond,&mdash;darkness, solitude. I may save her yet. The tyrant shall
      fall the day before that which he has set apart for slaughter! For the
      first time I mix among the broils and stratagems of men, and my mind leaps
      up from my despair, armed and eager for the contest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      A crowd had gathered round the Rue St. Honore; a young man was just
      arrested by the order of Robespierre. He was known to be in the service of
      Tallien, that hostile leader in the Convention, whom the tyrant had
      hitherto trembled to attack. This incident had therefore produced a
      greater excitement than a circumstance so customary as an arrest in the
      Reign of Terror might be supposed to create. Amongst the crowd were many
      friends of Tallien, many foes to the tyrant, many weary of beholding the
      tiger dragging victim after victim to its den. Hoarse, foreboding murmurs
      were heard; fierce eyes glared upon the officers as they seized their
      prisoner; and though they did not yet dare openly to resist, those in the
      rear pressed on those behind, and encumbered the path of the captive and
      his captors. The young man struggled hard for escape, and, by a violent
      effort, at last wrenched himself from the grasp. The crowd made way, and
      closed round to protect him, as he dived and darted through their ranks;
      but suddenly the trampling of horses was heard at hand,&mdash;the savage
      Henriot and his troop were bearing down upon the mob. The crowd gave way
      in alarm, and the prisoner was again seized by one of the partisans of the
      Dictator. At that moment a voice whispered the prisoner, &ldquo;Thou hast a
      letter which, if found on thee, ruins thy last hope. Give it to me! I will
      bear it to Tallien.&rdquo; The prisoner turned in amaze, read something that
      encouraged him in the eyes of the stranger who thus accosted him. The
      troop were now on the spot; the Jacobin who had seized the prisoner
      released hold of him for a moment to escape the hoofs of the horses: in
      that moment the opportunity was found,&mdash;the stranger had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      At the house of Tallien the principal foes of the tyrant were assembled.
      Common danger made common fellowship. All factions laid aside their feuds
      for the hour to unite against the formidable man who was marching over all
      factions to his gory throne. There was bold Lecointre, the declared enemy;
      there, creeping Barrere, who would reconcile all extremes, the hero of the
      cowards; Barras, calm and collected; Collet d&rsquo;Herbois, breathing wrath and
      vengeance, and seeing not that the crimes of Robespierre alone sheltered
      his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The council was agitated and irresolute. The awe which the uniform success
      and the prodigious energy of Robespierre excited still held the greater
      part under its control. Tallien, whom the tyrant most feared, and who
      alone could give head and substance and direction to so many contradictory
      passions, was too sullied by the memory of his own cruelties not to feel
      embarrassed by his position as the champion of mercy. &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he
      said, after an animating harangue from Lecointre, &ldquo;that the Usurper
      menaces us all. But he is still so beloved by his mobs,&mdash;still so
      supported by his Jacobins: better delay open hostilities till the hour is
      more ripe. To attempt and not succeed is to give us, bound hand and foot,
      to the guillotine. Every day his power must decline. Procrastination is
      our best ally&mdash;&rdquo; While yet speaking, and while yet producing the
      effect of water on the fire, it was announced that a stranger demanded to
      see him instantly on business that brooked no delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not at leisure,&rdquo; said the orator, impatiently. The servant placed a
      note on the table. Tallien opened it, and found these words in pencil,
      &ldquo;From the prison of Teresa de Fontenai.&rdquo; He turned pale, started up, and
      hastened to the anteroom, where he beheld a face entirely strange to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope of France!&rdquo; said the visitor to him, and the very sound of his voice
      went straight to the heart,&mdash;&ldquo;your servant is arrested in the
      streets. I have saved your life, and that of your wife who will be. I
      bring to you this letter from Teresa de Fontenai.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tallien, with a trembling hand, opened the letter, and read,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I forever to implore you in vain? Again and again I say, &lsquo;Lose not an
      hour if you value my life and your own.&rsquo; My trial and death are fixed the
      third day from this,&mdash;the 10th Thermidor. Strike while it is yet
      time,&mdash;strike the monster!&mdash;you have two days yet. If you fail,&mdash;if
      you procrastinate,&mdash;see me for the last time as I pass your windows
      to the guillotine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her trial will give proof against you,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;Her death is
      the herald of your own. Fear not the populace,&mdash;the populace would
      have rescued your servant. Fear not Robespierre,&mdash;he gives himself to
      your hands. To-morrow he comes to the Convention,&mdash;to-morrow you must
      cast the last throw for his head or your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow he comes to the Convention! And who are you that know so well
      what is concealed from me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man like you, who would save the woman he loves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Tallien could recover his surprise, the visitor was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back went the Avenger to his conclave an altered man. &ldquo;I have heard
      tidings,&mdash;no matter what,&rdquo; he cried,&mdash;&ldquo;that have changed my
      purpose. On the 10th we are destined to the guillotine. I revoke my
      counsel for delay. Robespierre comes to the Convention to-morrow; THERE we
      must confront and crush him. From the Mountain shall frown against him the
      grim shade of Danton,&mdash;from the Plain shall rise, in their bloody
      cerements, the spectres of Vergniaud and Condorcet. Frappons!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frappons!&rdquo; cried even Barrere, startled into energy by the new daring of
      his colleague,&mdash;&ldquo;frappons! il n&rsquo;y a que les morts qui ne reviennent
      pas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was observable (and the fact may be found in one of the memoirs of the
      time) that, during that day and night (the 7th Thermidor), a stranger to
      all the previous events of that stormy time was seen in various parts of
      the city,&mdash;in the cafes, the clubs, the haunts of the various
      factions; that, to the astonishment and dismay of his hearers, he talked
      aloud of the crimes of Robespierre, and predicted his coming fall; and, as
      he spoke, he stirred up the hearts of men, he loosed the bonds of their
      fear,&mdash;he inflamed them with unwonted rage and daring. But what
      surprised them most was, that no voice replied, no hand was lifted against
      him, no minion, even of the tyrant, cried, &ldquo;Arrest the traitor.&rdquo; In that
      impunity men read, as in a book, that the populace had deserted the man of
      blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once only a fierce, brawny Jacobin sprang up from the table at which he
      sat, drinking deep, and, approaching the stranger, said, &ldquo;I seize thee, in
      the name of the Republic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Citizen Aristides,&rdquo; answered the stranger, in a whisper, &ldquo;go to the
      lodgings of Robespierre,&mdash;he is from home; and in the left pocket of
      the vest which he cast off not an hour since thou wilt find a paper; when
      thou hast read that, return. I will await thee; and if thou wouldst then
      seize me, I will go without a struggle. Look round on those lowering
      brows; touch me NOW, and thou wilt be torn to pieces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Jacobin felt as if compelled to obey against his will. He went forth
      muttering; he returned,&mdash;the stranger was still there. &ldquo;Mille
      tonnerres,&rdquo; he said to him, &ldquo;I thank thee; the poltroon had my name in his
      list for the guillotine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that the Jacobin Aristides sprang upon the table and shouted, &ldquo;Death
      to the Tyrant!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER 7.XI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Le lendemain, 8 Thermidor, Robespierre se decida a prononcer son
     fameux discours.
     &mdash;Thiers, &ldquo;Hist. de la Revolution.&rdquo;
 
     (The next day, 8th Thermidor, Robespierre resolved to deliver his
     celebrated discourse.)
</pre>
    <p>
      The morning rose,&mdash;the 8th of Thermidor (July 26). Robespierre has
      gone to the Convention. He has gone with his laboured speech; he has gone
      with his phrases of philanthropy and virtue; he has gone to single out his
      prey. All his agents are prepared for his reception; the fierce St. Just
      has arrived from the armies to second his courage and inflame his wrath.
      His ominous apparition prepares the audience for the crisis. &ldquo;Citizens!&rdquo;
       screeched the shrill voice of Robespierre &ldquo;others have placed before you
      flattering pictures; I come to announce to you useful truths.
    </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they attribute to me,&mdash;to me alone!&mdash;whatever of harsh or
      evil is committed: it is Robespierre who wishes it; it is Robespierre who
      ordains it. Is there a new tax?&mdash;it is Robespierre who ruins you.
      They call me tyrant!&mdash;and why? Because I have acquired some
      influence; but how?&mdash;in speaking truth; and who pretends that truth
      is to be without force in the mouths of the Representatives of the French
      people? Doubtless, truth has its power, its rage, its despotism, its
      accents, touching, terrible, which resound in the pure heart as in the
      guilty conscience; and which Falsehood can no more imitate than Salmoneus
      could forge the thunderbolts of Heaven. What am I whom they accuse? A
      slave of liberty,&mdash;a living martyr of the Republic; the victim as the
      enemy of crime! All ruffianism affronts me, and actions legitimate in
      others are crimes in me. It is enough to know me to be calumniated. It is
      in my very zeal that they discover my guilt. Take from me my conscience,
      and I should be the most miserable of men!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused; and Couthon wiped his eyes, and St. Just murmured applause as
      with stern looks he gazed on the rebellious Mountain; and there was a
      dead, mournful, and chilling silence through the audience. The touching
      sentiment woke no echo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orator cast his eyes around. Ho! he will soon arouse that apathy. He
      proceeds, he praises, he pities himself no more. He denounces,&mdash;he
      accuses. Overflooded with his venom, he vomits it forth on all. At home,
      abroad, finances, war,&mdash;on all! Shriller and sharper rose his voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A conspiracy exists against the public liberty. It owes its strength to a
      criminal coalition in the very bosom of the Convention; it has accomplices
      in the bosom of the Committee of Public Safety...What is the remedy to
      this evil? To punish the traitors; to purify this committee; to crush all
      factions by the weight of the National Authority; to raise upon their
      ruins the power of Liberty and Justice. Such are the principles of that
      Reform. Must I be ambitious to profess them?&mdash;then the principles are
      proscribed, and Tyranny reigns amongst us! For what can you object to a
      man who is in the right, and has at least this knowledge,&mdash;he knows
      how to die for his native land! I am made to combat crime, and not to
      govern it. The time, alas! is not yet arrived when men of worth can serve
      with impunity their country. So long as the knaves rule, the defenders of
      liberty will be only the proscribed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For two hours, through that cold and gloomy audience, shrilled the
      Death-speech. In silence it began, in silence closed. The enemies of the
      orator were afraid to express resentment; they knew not yet the exact
      balance of power. His partisans were afraid to approve; they knew not whom
      of their own friends and relations the accusations were designed to single
      forth. &ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; whispered each to each; &ldquo;it is thou whom he
      threatens.&rdquo; But silent though the audience, it was, at the first, wellnigh
      subdued. There was still about this terrible man the spell of an
      overmastering will. Always&mdash;though not what is called a great orator&mdash;resolute,
      and sovereign in the use of words; words seemed as things when uttered by
      one who with a nod moved the troops of Henriot, and influenced the
      judgment of Rene Dumas, grim President of the Tribunal. Lecointre of
      Versailles rose, and there was an anxious movement of attention; for
      Lecointre was one of the fiercest foes of the tyrant. What was the dismay
      of the Tallien faction; what the complacent smile of Couthon,&mdash;when
      Lecointre demanded only that the oration should be printed! All seemed
      paralyzed. At length Bourdon de l&rsquo;Oise, whose name was doubly marked in
      the black list of the Dictator, stalked to the tribune, and moved the bold
      counter-resolution, that the speech should be referred to the two
      committees whom that very speech accused. Still no applause from the
      conspirators; they sat torpid as frozen men. The shrinking Barrere, ever
      on the prudent side, looked round before he rose. He rises, and sides with
      Lecointre! Then Couthon seized the occasion, and from his seat (a
      privilege permitted only to the paralytic philanthropist) (M. Thiers in
      his History, volume iv. page 79, makes a curious blunder: he says,
      &ldquo;Couthon s&rsquo;elance a la tribune.&rdquo; (Couthon darted towards the tribune.)
      Poor Couthon! whose half body was dead, and who was always wheeled in his
      chair into the Convention, and spoke sitting.), and with his melodious
      voice sought to convert the crisis into a triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      He demanded, not only that the harangue should be printed, but sent to all
      the communes and all the armies. It was necessary to soothe a wronged and
      ulcerated heart. Deputies, the most faithful, had been accused of shedding
      blood. &ldquo;Ah! if HE had contributed to the death of one innocent man, he
      should immolate himself with grief.&rdquo; Beautiful tenderness!&mdash;and while
      he spoke, he fondled the spaniel in his bosom. Bravo, Couthon! Robespierre
      triumphs! The reign of Terror shall endure! The old submission settles
      dovelike back in the assembly! They vote the printing of the Death-speech,
      and its transmission to all the municipalities. From the benches of the
      Mountain, Tallien, alarmed, dismayed, impatient, and indignant, cast his
      gaze where sat the strangers admitted to hear the debates; and suddenly he
      met the eyes of the Unknown who had brought to him the letter from Teresa
      de Fontenai the preceding day. The eyes fascinated him as he gazed. In
      aftertimes he often said that their regard, fixed, earnest,
      half-reproachful, and yet cheering and triumphant, filled him with new
      life and courage. They spoke to his heart as the trumpet speaks to the
      war-horse. He moved from his seat; he whispered with his allies: the
      spirit he had drawn in was contagious; the men whom Robespierre especially
      had denounced, and who saw the sword over their heads, woke from their
      torpid trance. Vadier, Cambon, Billaud-Varennes, Panis, Amar, rose at
      once,&mdash;all at once demanded speech. Vadier is first heard, the rest
      succeed. It burst forth, the Mountain, with its fires and consuming lava;
      flood upon flood they rush, a legion of Ciceros upon the startled
      Catiline! Robespierre falters, hesitates,&mdash;would qualify, retract.
      They gather new courage from his new fears; they interrupt him; they drown
      his voice; they demand the reversal of the motion. Amar moves again that
      the speech be referred to the Committees, to the Committees,&mdash;to his
      enemies! Confusion and noise and clamour! Robespierre wraps himself in
      silent and superb disdain. Pale, defeated, but not yet destroyed, he
      stands,&mdash;a storm in the midst of storm!
    </p>
    <p>
      The motion is carried. All men foresee in that defeat the Dictator&rsquo;s
      downfall. A solitary cry rose from the galleries; it was caught up; it
      circled through the hall, the audience: &ldquo;A bas le tyrant! Vive la
      republique!&rdquo; (Down with the tyrant! Hurrah for the republic!)

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Aupres d&rsquo;un corps aussi avili que la Convention, il restait des
     chances pour que Robespierre sortit vainqueur de cette lutte.
     Lacretelle, volume xii.

     (Amongst a body so debased as the Convention, there still
     remained some chances that Robespierre would come off victor in
     the struggle.)
</pre>
    <p>
      As Robespierre left the hall, there was a dead and ominous silence in the
      crowd without. The herd, in every country, side with success; and the rats
      run from the falling tower. But Robespierre, who wanted courage, never
      wanted pride, and the last often supplied the place of the first;
      thoughtfully, and with an impenetrable brow, he passed through the throng,
      leaning on St. Just, Payan and his brother following him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they got into the open space, Robespierre abruptly broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many heads were to fall upon the tenth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighty,&rdquo; replied Payan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, we must not tarry so long; a day may lose an empire: terrorism must
      serve us yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent a few moments, and his eyes roved suspiciously through the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;St. Just,&rdquo; he said abruptly, &ldquo;they have not found this Englishman whose
      revelations, or whose trial, would have crushed the Amars and the
      Talliens. No, no! my Jacobins themselves are growing dull and blind. But
      they have seized a woman,&mdash;only a woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s hand stabbed Marat,&rdquo; said St. Just. Robespierre stopped short,
      and breathed hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;St. Just,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when this peril is past, we will found the Reign of
      Peace. There shall be homes and gardens set apart for the old. David is
      already designing the porticos. Virtuous men shall be appointed to
      instruct the young. All vice and disorder shall be NOT exterminated&mdash;no,
      no! only banished! We must not die yet. Posterity cannot judge us till our
      work is done. We have recalled L&rsquo;Etre Supreme; we must now remodel this
      corrupted world. All shall be love and brotherhood; and&mdash;ho! Simon!
      Simon!&mdash;hold! Your pencil, St. Just!&rdquo; And Robespierre wrote hastily.
      &ldquo;This to Citizen President Dumas. Go with it quick, Simon. These eighty
      heads must fall TO-MORROW,&mdash;TO-MORROW, Simon. Dumas will advance
      their trial a day. I will write to Fouquier-Tinville, the public accuser.
      We meet at the Jacobins to-night, Simon; there we will denounce the
      Convention itself; there we will rally round us the last friends of
      liberty and France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shout was heard in the distance behind, &ldquo;Vive la republique!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tyrant&rsquo;s eye shot a vindictive gleam. &ldquo;The republic!&mdash;faugh! We
      did not destroy the throne of a thousand years for that canaille!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      THE TRIAL, THE EXECUTION, OF THE VICTIMS IS ADVANCED A DAY! By the aid of
      the mysterious intelligence that had guided and animated him hitherto,
      Zanoni learned that his arts had been in vain. He knew that Viola was
      safe, if she could but survive an hour the life of the tyrant. He knew
      that Robespierre&rsquo;s hours were numbered; that the 10th of Thermidor, on
      which he had originally designed the execution of his last victims, would
      see himself at the scaffold. Zanoni had toiled, had schemed for the fall
      of the Butcher and his reign. To what end? A single word from the tyrant
      had baffled the result of all. The execution of Viola is advanced a day.
      Vain seer, who wouldst make thyself the instrument of the Eternal, the
      very dangers that now beset the tyrant but expedite the doom of his
      victims! To-morrow, eighty heads, and hers whose pillow has been thy
      heart! To-morrow! and Maximilien is safe to-night!

     (Earth may crumble back into earth; the Spirit will still escape

</pre>
    <p>
      To-morrow!&mdash;and it is already twilight. One after one, the gentle
      stars come smiling through the heaven. The Seine, in its slow waters, yet
      trembles with the last kiss of the rosy day; and still in the blue sky
      gleams the spire of Notre Dame; and still in the blue sky looms the
      guillotine by the Barriere du Trone. Turn to that time-worn building, once
      the church and the convent of the Freres-Precheurs, known by the then holy
      name of Jacobins; there the new Jacobins hold their club. There, in that
      oblong hall, once the library of the peaceful monks, assemble the
      idolaters of St. Robespierre. Two immense tribunes, raised at either end,
      contain the lees and dregs of the atrocious populace,&mdash;the majority
      of that audience consisting of the furies of the guillotine (furies de
      guillotine). In the midst of the hall are the bureau and chair of the
      president,&mdash;the chair long preserved by the piety of the monks as the
      relic of St. Thomas Aquinas! Above this seat scowls the harsh bust of
      Brutus. An iron lamp and two branches scatter over the vast room a murky,
      fuliginous ray, beneath the light of which the fierce faces of that
      Pandemonium seem more grim and haggard. There, from the orator&rsquo;s tribune,
      shrieks the shrill wrath of Robespierre!
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile all is chaos, disorder, half daring and half cowardice, in the
      Committee of his foes. Rumours fly from street to street, from haunt to
      haunt, from house to house. The swallows flit low, and the cattle group
      together before the storm. And above this roar of the lives and things of
      the little hour, alone in his chamber stood he on whose starry youth&mdash;symbol
      of the imperishable bloom of the calm Ideal amidst the mouldering Actual&mdash;the
      clouds of ages had rolled in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      All those exertions which ordinary wit and courage could suggest had been
      tried in vain. All such exertions WERE in vain, where, in that Saturnalia
      of death, a life was the object. Nothing but the fall of Robespierre could
      have saved his victims; now, too late, that fall would only serve to
      avenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more, in that last agony of excitement and despair, the seer had
      plunged into solitude, to invoke again the aid or counsel of those
      mysterious intermediates between earth and heaven who had renounced the
      intercourse of the spirit when subjected to the common bondage of the
      mortal. In the intense desire and anguish of his heart, perhaps, lay a
      power not yet called forth; for who has not felt that the sharpness of
      extreme grief cuts and grinds away many of those strongest bonds of
      infirmity and doubt which bind down the souls of men to the cabined
      darkness of the hour; and that from the cloud and thunderstorm often
      swoops the Olympian eagle that can ravish us aloft!
    </p>
    <p>
      And the invocation was heard,&mdash;the bondage of sense was rent away
      from the visual mind. He looked, and saw,&mdash;no, not the being he had
      called, with its limbs of light and unutterably tranquil smile&mdash;not
      his familiar, Adon-Ai, the Son of Glory and the Star, but the Evil Omen,
      the dark Chimera, the implacable Foe, with exultation and malice burning
      in its hell-lit eyes. The Spectre, no longer cowering and retreating into
      shadow, rose before him, gigantic and erect; the face, whose veil no
      mortal hand had ever raised, was still concealed, but the form was more
      distinct, corporeal, and cast from it, as an atmosphere, horror and rage
      and awe. As an iceberg, the breath of that presence froze the air; as a
      cloud, it filled the chamber and blackened the stars from heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lo!&rdquo; said its voice, &ldquo;I am here once more. Thou hast robbed me of a
      meaner prey. Now exorcise THYSELF from my power! Thy life has left thee,
      to live in the heart of a daughter of the charnel and the worm. In that
      life I come to thee with my inexorable tread. Thou art returned to the
      Threshold,&mdash;thou, whose steps have trodden the verges of the
      Infinite! And as the goblin of its fantasy seizes on a child in the dark,&mdash;mighty
      one, who wouldst conquer Death,&mdash;I seize on thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back to thy thraldom, slave! If thou art come to the voice that called
      thee not, it is again not to command, but to obey! Thou, from whose
      whisper I gained the boons of the lives lovelier and dearer than my own;
      thou&mdash;I command thee, not by spell and charm, but by the force of a
      soul mightier than the malice of thy being,&mdash;thou serve me yet, and
      speak again the secret that can rescue the lives thou hast, by permission
      of the Universal Master, permitted me to retain awhile in the temple of
      the clay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brighter and more devouringly burned the glare from those lurid eyes; more
      visible and colossal yet rose the dilating shape; a yet fiercer and more
      disdainful hate spoke in the voice that answered, &ldquo;Didst thou think that
      my boon would be other than thy curse? Happy for thee hadst thou mourned
      over the deaths which come by the gentle hand of Nature,&mdash;hadst thou
      never known how the name of mother consecrates the face of Beauty, and
      never, bending over thy first-born, felt the imperishable sweetness of a
      father&rsquo;s love! They are saved, for what?&mdash;the mother, for the death
      of violence and shame and blood, for the doomsman&rsquo;s hand to put aside that
      shining hair which has entangled thy bridegroom kisses; the child, first
      and last of thine offspring, in whom thou didst hope to found a race that
      should hear with thee the music of celestial harps, and float, by the side
      of thy familiar, Adon-Ai, through the azure rivers of joy,&mdash;the
      child, to live on a few days as a fungus in a burial-vault, a thing of the
      loathsome dungeon, dying of cruelty and neglect and famine. Ha! ha! thou
      who wouldst baffle Death, learn how the deathless die if they dare to love
      the mortal. Now, Chaldean, behold my boons! Now I seize and wrap thee with
      the pestilence of my presence; now, evermore, till thy long race is run,
      mine eyes shall glow into thy brain, and mine arms shall clasp thee, when
      thou wouldst take the wings of the Morning and flee from the embrace of
      Night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell thee, no! And again I compel thee, speak and answer to the lord
      who can command his slave. I know, though my lore fails me, and the reeds
      on which I leaned pierce my side,&mdash;I know yet that it is written that
      the life of which I question can be saved from the headsman. Thou wrappest
      her future in the darkness of thy shadow, but thou canst not shape it.
      Thou mayest foreshow the antidote; thou canst not effect the bane. From
      thee I wring the secret, though it torture thee to name it. I approach
      thee,&mdash;I look dauntless into thine eyes. The soul that loves can dare
      all things. Shadow, I defy thee, and compel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The spectre waned and recoiled. Like a vapour that lessens as the sun
      pierces and pervades it, the form shrank cowering and dwarfed in the
      dimmer distance, and through the casement again rushed the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Voice, with a faint and hollow accent, &ldquo;thou CANST save
      her from the headsman; for it is written, that sacrifice can save. Ha!
      ha!&rdquo; And the shape again suddenly dilated into the gloom of its giant
      stature, and its ghastly laugh exulted, as if the Foe, a moment baffled,
      had regained its might. &ldquo;Ha! ha!&mdash;thou canst save her life, if thou
      wilt sacrifice thine own! Is it for this thou hast lived on through
      crumbling empires and countless generations of thy race? At last shall
      Death reclaim thee? Wouldst thou save her?&mdash;DIE FOR HER! Fall, O
      stately column, over which stars yet unformed may gleam,&mdash;fall, that
      the herb at thy base may drink a few hours longer the sunlight and the
      dews! Silent! Art thou ready for the sacrifice? See, the moon moves up
      through heaven. Beautiful and wise one, wilt thou bid her smile to-morrow
      on thy headless clay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back! for my soul, in answering thee from depths where thou canst not
      hear it, has regained its glory; and I hear the wings of Adon-Ai gliding
      musical through the air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke; and, with a low shriek of baffled rage and hate, the Thing was
      gone, and through the room rushed, luminous and sudden, the Presence of
      silvery light.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the heavenly visitor stood in the atmosphere of his own lustre, and
      looked upon the face of the Theurgist with an aspect of ineffable
      tenderness and love, all space seemed lighted from his smile. Along the
      blue air without, from that chamber in which his wings had halted, to the
      farthest star in the azure distance, it seemed as if the track of his
      flight were visible, by a lengthened splendour in the air, like the column
      of moonlight on the sea. Like the flower that diffuses perfume as the very
      breath of its life, so the emanation of that presence was joy. Over the
      world, as a million times swifter than light, than electricity, the Son of
      Glory had sped his way to the side of love, his wings had scattered
      delight as the morning scatters dew. For that brief moment, Poverty had
      ceased to mourn, Disease fled from its prey, and Hope breathed a dream of
      Heaven into the darkness of Despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art right,&rdquo; said the melodious Voice. &ldquo;Thy courage has restored thy
      power. Once more, in the haunts of earth, thy soul charms me to thy side.
      Wiser now, in the moment when thou comprehendest Death, than when thy
      unfettered spirit learned the solemn mystery of Life; the human affections
      that thralled and humbled thee awhile bring to thee, in these last hours
      of thy mortality, the sublimest heritage of thy race,&mdash;the eternity
      that commences from the grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Adon-Ai,&rdquo; said the Chaldean, as, circumfused in the splendour of the
      visitant, a glory more radiant than human beauty settled round his form,
      and seemed already to belong to the eternity of which the Bright One
      spoke, &ldquo;as men, before they die, see and comprehend the enigmas hidden
      from them before (The greatest poet, and one of the noblest thinkers, of
      the last age, said, on his deathbed, &ldquo;Many things obscure to me before,
      now clear up, and become visible.&rdquo;&mdash;See the &lsquo;Life of Schiller.&rsquo;), &ldquo;so
      in this hour, when the sacrifice of self to another brings the course of
      ages to its goal, I see the littleness of Life, compared to the majesty of
      Death; but oh, Divine Consoler, even here, even in thy presence, the
      affections that inspire me, sadden. To leave behind me in this bad world,
      unaided, unprotected, those for whom I die! the wife! the child!&mdash;oh,
      speak comfort to me in this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what,&rdquo; said the visitor, with a slight accent of reproof in the tone
      of celestial pity,&mdash;&ldquo;what, with all thy wisdom and thy starry
      secrets, with all thy empire of the past, and thy visions of the future;
      what art thou to the All-Directing and Omniscient? Canst thou yet imagine
      that thy presence on earth can give to the hearts thou lovest the shelter
      which the humblest take from the wings of the Presence that lives in
      heaven? Fear not thou for their future. Whether thou live or die, their
      future is the care of the Most High! In the dungeon and on the scaffold
      looks everlasting the Eye of HIM, tenderer than thou to love, wiser than
      thou to guide, mightier than thou to save!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zanoni bowed his head; and when he looked up again, the last shadow had
      left his brow. The visitor was gone; but still the glory of his presence
      seemed to shine upon the spot, still the solitary air seemed to murmur
      with tremulous delight. And thus ever shall it be with those who have
      once, detaching themselves utterly from life, received the visit of the
      Angel FAITH. Solitude and space retain the splendour, and it settles like
      a halo round their graves.

     Aufgeschauet liebewarm,

     Trag&rsquo; ihn in die blaue Ferne.
     &mdash;Uhland, &ldquo;An den Tod.&rdquo;
 
     Then towards the Garden of the Star
     Lift up thine aspect warm with love,
     And, friendlike link&rsquo;d through space afar,
     Mount with him, arm in arm, above.
     &mdash;Uhland, &ldquo;Poem to Death.&rdquo;
  </pre>
    <p>
      He stood upon the lofty balcony that overlooked the quiet city. Though
      afar, the fiercest passions of men were at work on the web of strife and
      doom, all that gave itself to his view was calm and still in the rays of
      the summer moon, for his soul was wrapped from man and man&rsquo;s narrow
      sphere, and only the serener glories of creation were present to the
      vision of the seer. There he stood, alone and thoughtful, to take the last
      farewell of the wondrous life that he had known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coursing through the fields of space, he beheld the gossamer shapes, whose
      choral joys his spirit had so often shared. There, group upon group, they
      circled in the starry silence multiform in the unimaginable beauty of a
      being fed by ambrosial dews and serenest light. In his trance, all the
      universe stretched visible beyond; in the green valleys afar, he saw the
      dances of the fairies; in the bowels of the mountains, he beheld the race
      that breathe the lurid air of the volcanoes, and hide from the light of
      heaven; on every leaf in the numberless forests, in every drop of the
      unmeasured seas, he surveyed its separate and swarming world; far up, in
      the farthest blue, he saw orb upon orb ripening into shape, and planets
      starting from the central fire, to run their day of ten thousand years.
      For everywhere in creation is the breath of the Creator, and in every spot
      where the breath breathes is life! And alone, in the distance, the lonely
      man beheld his Magian brother. There, at work with his numbers and his
      Cabala, amidst the wrecks of Rome, passionless and calm, sat in his cell
      the mystic Mejnour,&mdash;living on, living ever while the world lasts,
      indifferent whether his knowledge produces weal or woe; a mechanical agent
      of a more tender and a wiser will, that guides every spring to its
      inscrutable designs. Living on,&mdash;living ever,&mdash;as science that
      cares alone for knowledge, and halts not to consider how knowledge
      advances happiness; how Human Improvement, rushing through civilisation,
      crushes in its march all who cannot grapple to its wheels (&ldquo;You colonise
      the lands of the savage with the Anglo-Saxon,&mdash;you civilise that
      portion of THE EARTH; but is the SAVAGE civilised? He is exterminated! You
      accumulate machinery,&mdash;you increase the total of wealth; but what
      becomes of the labour you displace? One generation is sacrificed to the
      next. You diffuse knowledge,&mdash;and the world seems to grow brighter;
      but Discontent at Poverty replaces Ignorance, happy with its crust. Every
      improvement, every advancement in civilisation, injures some, to benefit
      others, and either cherishes the want of to-day, or prepares the
      revolution of to-morrow.&rdquo;&mdash;Stephen Montague.); ever, with its Cabala
      and its number, lives on to change, in its bloodless movements, the face
      of the habitable world!
    </p>
    <p>
      And, &ldquo;Oh, farewell to life!&rdquo; murmured the glorious dreamer. &ldquo;Sweet, O
      life! hast thou been to me. How fathomless thy joys,&mdash;how rapturously
      has my soul bounded forth upon the upward paths! To him who forever renews
      his youth in the clear fount of Nature, how exquisite is the mere
      happiness TO BE! Farewell, ye lamps of heaven, and ye million tribes, the
      Populace of Air. Not a mote in the beam, not an herb on the mountain, not
      a pebble on the shore, not a seed far-blown into the wilderness, but
      contributed to the lore that sought in all the true principle of life, the
      Beautiful, the Joyous, the Immortal. To others, a land, a city, a hearth,
      has been a home; MY home has been wherever the intellect could pierce, or
      the spirit could breathe the air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and through the immeasurable space his eyes and his heart,
      penetrating the dismal dungeon, rested on his child. He saw it slumbering
      in the arms of the pale mother, and HIS soul spoke to the sleeping soul.
      &ldquo;Forgive me, if my desire was sin; I dreamed to have reared and nurtured
      thee to the divinest destinies my visions could foresee. Betimes, as the
      mortal part was strengthened against disease, to have purified the
      spiritual from every sin; to have led thee, heaven upon heaven, through
      the holy ecstasies which make up the existence of the orders that dwell on
      high; to have formed, from thy sublime affections, the pure and
      ever-living communication between thy mother and myself. The dream was but
      a dream&mdash;it is no more! In sight myself of the grave, I feel, at
      last, that through the portals of the grave lies the true initiation into
      the holy and the wise. Beyond those portals I await ye both, beloved
      pilgrims!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From his numbers and his Cabala, in his cell, amidst the wrecks of Rome,
      Mejnour, startled, looked up, and through the spirit, felt that the spirit
      of his distant friend addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fare thee well forever upon this earth! Thy last companion forsakes thy
      side. Thine age survives the youth of all; and the Final Day shall find
      thee still the contemplator of our tombs. I go with my free will into the
      land of darkness; but new suns and systems blaze around us from the grave.
      I go where the souls of those for whom I resign the clay shall be my
      co-mates through eternal youth. At last I recognise the true ordeal and
      the real victory. Mejnour, cast down thy elixir; lay by thy load of years!
      Wherever the soul can wander, the Eternal Soul of all things protects it
      still!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER 7.XV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Il ne veulent plus perdre un moment d&rsquo;une nuit si precieuse.
     Lacretelle, tom. xii.

     (They would not lose another moment of so precious a night.)
</pre>
    <p>
      It was late that night, and Rene-Francois Dumas, President of the
      Revolutionary Tribunal, had re-entered his cabinet, on his return from the
      Jacobin Club. With him were two men who might be said to represent, the
      one the moral, the other the physical force of the Reign of Terror:
      Fouquier-Tinville, the Public Accuser, and Francois Henriot, the General
      of the Parisian National Guard. This formidable triumvirate were assembled
      to debate on the proceedings of the next day; and the three sister-witches
      over their hellish caldron were scarcely animated by a more fiend-like
      spirit, or engaged in more execrable designs, than these three heroes of
      the Revolution in their premeditated massacre of the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dumas was but little altered in appearance since, in the earlier part of
      this narrative, he was presented to the reader, except that his manner was
      somewhat more short and severe, and his eye yet more restless. But he
      seemed almost a superior being by the side of his associates. Rene Dumas,
      born of respectable parents, and well educated, despite his ferocity, was
      not without a certain refinement, which perhaps rendered him the more
      acceptable to the precise and formal Robespierre. (Dumas was a beau in his
      way. His gala-dress was a BLOOD-RED COAT, with the finest ruffles.) But
      Henriot had been a lackey, a thief, a spy of the police; he had drunk the
      blood of Madame de Lamballe, and had risen to his present rank for no
      quality but his ruffianism; and Fouquier-Tinville, the son of a provincial
      agriculturist, and afterwards a clerk at the Bureau of the Police, was
      little less base in his manners, and yet more, from a certain loathsome
      buffoonery, revolting in his speech,&mdash;bull-headed, with black, sleek
      hair, with a narrow and livid forehead, with small eyes, that twinkled
      with a sinister malice; strongly and coarsely built, he looked what he
      was, the audacious bully of a lawless and relentless Bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dumas trimmed the candles, and bent over the list of the victims for the
      morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a long catalogue,&rdquo; said the president; &ldquo;eighty trials for one day!
      And Robespierre&rsquo;s orders to despatch the whole fournee are unequivocal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Fouquier, with a coarse, loud laugh; &ldquo;we must try them en
      masse. I know how to deal with our jury. &lsquo;Je pense, citoyens, que vous
      etes convaincus du crime des accuses?&rsquo; (I think, citizens, that you are
      convinced of the crime of the accused.) Ha! ha!&mdash;the longer the list,
      the shorter the work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; growled out Henriot, with an oath,&mdash;as usual, half-drunk,
      and lolling on his chair, with his spurred heels on the table,&mdash;&ldquo;little
      Tinville is the man for despatch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Citizen Henriot,&rdquo; said Dumas, gravely, &ldquo;permit me to request thee to
      select another footstool; and for the rest, let me warn thee that
      to-morrow is a critical and important day; one that will decide the fate
      of France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fig for little France! Vive le Vertueux Robespierre, la Colonne de la
      Republique! (Long life to the virtuous Robespierre, the pillar of the
      Republic!) Plague on this talking; it is dry work. Hast thou no eau de vie
      in that little cupboard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dumas and Fouquier exchanged looks of disgust. Dumas shrugged his
      shoulders, and replied,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to guard thee against eau de vie, Citizen General Henriot, that I
      have requested thee to meet me here. Listen if thou canst!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, talk away! thy metier is to talk, mine to fight and to drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, I tell thee then, the populace will be abroad; all factions
      will be astir. It is probable enough that they will even seek to arrest
      our tumbrils on their way to the guillotine. Have thy men armed and ready;
      keep the streets clear; cut down without mercy whomsoever may obstruct the
      ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Henriot, striking his sword so loudly that Dumas
      half-started at the clank,&mdash;&ldquo;Black Henriot is no &lsquo;Indulgent.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look to it, then, citizen,&mdash;look to it! And hark thee,&rdquo; he added,
      with a grave and sombre brow, &ldquo;if thou wouldst keep thine own head on thy
      shoulders, beware of the eau de vie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own head!&mdash;sacre mille tonnerres! Dost thou threaten the general
      of the Parisian army?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dumas, like Robespierre, a precise atrabilious, and arrogant man, was
      about to retort, when the craftier Tinville laid his hand on his arm, and,
      turning to the general, said, &ldquo;My dear Henriot, thy dauntless
      republicanism, which is too ready to give offence, must learn to take a
      reprimand from the representative of Republican Law. Seriously, mon cher,
      thou must be sober for the next three or four days; after the crisis is
      over, thou and I will drink a bottle together. Come, Dumas relax thine
      austerity, and shake hands with our friend. No quarrels amongst
      ourselves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dumas hesitated, and extended his hand, which the ruffian clasped; and,
      maudlin tears succeeding his ferocity, he half-sobbed, half-hiccoughed
      forth his protestations of civism and his promises of sobriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we depend on thee, mon general,&rdquo; said Dumas; &ldquo;and now, since we
      shall all have need of vigour for to-morrow, go home and sleep soundly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I forgive thee, Dumas,&mdash;I forgive thee. I am not vindictive,&mdash;I!
      but still, if a man threatens me; if a man insults me&mdash;&rdquo; and, with
      the quick changes of intoxication, again his eyes gleamed fire through
      their foul tears. With some difficulty Fouquier succeeded at last in
      soothing the brute, and leading him from the chamber. But still, as some
      wild beast disappointed of a prey, he growled and snarled as his heavy
      tread descended the stairs. A tall trooper, mounted, was leading Henriot&rsquo;s
      horse to and fro the streets; and as the general waited at the porch till
      his attendant turned, a stranger stationed by the wall accosted him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General Henriot, I have desired to speak with thee. Next to Robespierre,
      thou art, or shouldst be, the most powerful man in France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hem!&mdash;yes, I ought to be. What then?&mdash;every man has not his
      deserts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; said the stranger; &ldquo;thy pay is scarcely suitable to thy rank and
      thy wants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even in a revolution, a man takes care of his fortunes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diable! speak out, citizen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a thousand pieces of gold with me,&mdash;they are thine, if thou
      wilt grant me one small favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Citizen, I grant it!&rdquo; said Henriot, waving his hand majestically. &ldquo;Is it
      to denounce some rascal who has offended thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it is simply this: write these words to President Dumas, &lsquo;Admit the
      bearer to thy presence; and, if thou canst, grant him the request he will
      make to thee, it will be an inestimable obligation to Francois Henriot.&rsquo;&rdquo;
       The stranger, as he spoke, placed pencil and tablets in the shaking hands
      of the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is the gold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With some difficulty, Henriot scrawled the words dictated to him, clutched
      the gold, mounted his horse, and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Fouquier, when he had closed the door upon Henriot, said
      sharply, &ldquo;How canst thou be so mad as to incense that brigand? Knowest
      thou not that our laws are nothing without the physical force of the
      National Guard, and that he is their leader?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know this, that Robespierre must have been mad to place that drunkard
      at their head; and mark my words, Fouquier, if the struggle come, it is
      that man&rsquo;s incapacity and cowardice that will destroy us. Yes, thou mayst
      live thyself to accuse thy beloved Robespierre, and to perish in his
      fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For all that, we must keep well with Henriot till we can find the
      occasion to seize and behead him. To be safe, we must fawn on those who
      are still in power; and fawn the more, the more we would depose them. Do
      not think this Henriot, when he wakes to-morrow, will forget thy threats.
      He is the most revengeful of human beings. Thou must send and soothe him
      in the morning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said Dumas, convinced. &ldquo;I was too hasty; and now I think we have
      nothing further to do, since we have arranged to make short work with our
      fournee of to-morrow. I see in the list a knave I have long marked out,
      though his crime once procured me a legacy,&mdash;Nicot, the Hebertist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And young Andre Chenier, the poet? Ah, I forgot; we be headed HIM to-day!
      Revolutionary virtue is at its acme. His own brother abandoned him.&rdquo; (His
      brother is said, indeed, to have contributed to the condemnation of this
      virtuous and illustrious person. He was heard to cry aloud, &ldquo;Si mon frere
      est coupable, qu&rsquo;il perisse&rdquo; (If my brother be culpable, let him die).
      This brother, Marie-Joseph, also a poet, and the author of &ldquo;Charles IX.,&rdquo;
       so celebrated in the earlier days of the Revolution, enjoyed, of course,
      according to the wonted justice of the world, a triumphant career, and was
      proclaimed in the Champ de Mars &ldquo;le premier de poetes Francais,&rdquo; a title
      due to his murdered brother.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a foreigner,&mdash;an Italian woman in the list; but I can find
      no charge made out against her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same we must execute her for the sake of the round number; eighty
      sounds better than seventy-nine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here a huissier brought a paper on which was written the request of
      Henriot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! this is fortunate,&rdquo; said Tinville, to whom Dumas chucked the scroll,&mdash;&ldquo;grant
      the prayer by all means; so at least that it does not lessen our
      bead-roll. But I will do Henriot the justice to say that he never asks to
      let off, but to put on. Good-night! I am worn out&mdash;my escort waits
      below. Only on such an occasion would I venture forth in the streets at
      night.&rdquo; (During the latter part of the Reign of Terror, Fouquier rarely
      stirred out at night, and never without an escort. In the Reign of Terror
      those most terrified were its kings.) And Fouquier, with a long yawn,
      quitted the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admit the bearer!&rdquo; said Dumas, who, withered and dried, as lawyers in
      practice mostly are, seemed to require as little sleep as his parchments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rene-Francois Dumas,&rdquo; said he, seating himself opposite to the president,
      and markedly adopting the plural, as if in contempt of the revolutionary
      jargon, &ldquo;amidst the excitement and occupations of your later life, I know
      not if you can remember that we have met before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge scanned the features of his visitor, and a pale blush settled on
      his sallow cheeks, &ldquo;Yes, citizen, I remember!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you recall the words I then uttered! You spoke tenderly and
      philanthropically of your horror of capital executions; you exulted in the
      approaching Revolution as the termination of all sanguinary punishments;
      you quoted reverently the saying of Maximilien Robespierre, the rising
      statesman, &lsquo;The executioner is the invention of the tyrant:&rsquo; and I
      replied, that while you spoke, a foreboding seized me that we should meet
      again when your ideas of death and the philosophy of revolutions might be
      changed! Was I right, Citizen Rene-Francois Dumas, President of the
      Revolutionary Tribunal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Dumas, with some confusion on his brazen brow, &ldquo;I spoke then
      as men speak who have not acted. Revolutions are not made with rose-water!
      But truce to the gossip of the long-ago. I remember, also, that thou didst
      then save the life of my relation, and it will please thee to learn that
      his intended murderer will be guillotined to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That concerns yourself,&mdash;your justice or your revenge. Permit me the
      egotism to remind you that you then promised that if ever a day should
      come when you could serve me, your life&mdash;yes, the phrase was, &lsquo;your
      heart&rsquo;s blood&lsquo;&mdash;was at my bidding. Think not, austere judge,
      that I come to ask a boon that can affect yourself,&mdash;I come but to
      ask a day&rsquo;s respite for another!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Citizen, it is impossible! I have the order of Robespierre that not one
      less than the total on my list must undergo their trial for to-morrow. As
      for the verdict, that rests with the jury!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not ask you to diminish the catalogue. Listen still! In your
      death-roll there is the name of an Italian woman whose youth, whose
      beauty, and whose freedom not only from every crime, but every tangible
      charge, will excite only compassion, and not terror. Even YOU would
      tremble to pronounce her sentence. It will be dangerous on a day when the
      populace will be excited, when your tumbrils may be arrested, to expose
      youth and innocence and beauty to the pity and courage of a revolted
      crowd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dumas looked up and shrunk from the eye of the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not deny, citizen, that there is reason in what thou urgest. But my
      orders are positive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Positive only as to the number of the victims. I offer you a substitute
      for this one. I offer you the head of a man who knows all of the very
      conspiracy which now threatens Robespierre and yourself, and compared with
      one clew to which, you would think even eighty ordinary lives a cheap
      purchase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That alters the case,&rdquo; said Dumas, eagerly; &ldquo;if thou canst do this, on my
      own responsibility I will postpone the trial of the Italian. Now name the
      proxy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You behold him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou!&rdquo; exclaimed Dumas, while a fear he could not conceal betrayed itself
      through his surprise. &ldquo;Thou!&mdash;and thou comest to me alone at night,
      to offer thyself to justice. Ha!&mdash;this is a snare. Tremble, fool!&mdash;thou
      art in my power, and I can have BOTH!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can,&rdquo; said the stranger, with a calm smile of disdain; &ldquo;but my life
      is valueless without my revelations. Sit still, I command you,&mdash;hear
      me!&rdquo; and the light in those dauntless eyes spell-bound and awed the judge.
      &ldquo;You will remove me to the Conciergerie,&mdash;you will fix my trial,
      under the name of Zanoni, amidst your fournee of to-morrow. If I do not
      satisfy you by my speech, you hold the woman I die to save as your
      hostage. It is but the reprieve for her of a single day that I demand. The
      day following the morrow I shall be dust, and you may wreak your vengeance
      on the life that remains. Tush! judge and condemner of thousands, do you
      hesitate,&mdash;do you imagine that the man who voluntarily offers himself
      to death will be daunted into uttering one syllable at your Bar against
      his will? Have you not had experience enough of the inflexibility of pride
      and courage? President, I place before you the ink and implements! Write
      to the jailer a reprieve of one day for the woman whose life can avail you
      nothing, and I will bear the order to my own prison: I, who can now tell
      this much as an earnest of what I can communicate,&mdash;while I speak,
      your own name, judge, is in a list of death. I can tell you by whose hand
      it is written down; I can tell you in what quarter to look for danger; I
      can tell you from what cloud, in this lurid atmosphere, hangs the storm
      that shall burst on Robespierre and his reign!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dumas grew pale; and his eyes vainly sought to escape the magnetic gaze
      that overpowered and mastered him. Mechanically, and as if under an agency
      not his own, he wrote while the stranger dictated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said then, forcing a smile to his lips, &ldquo;I promised I would
      serve you; see, I am faithful to my word. I suppose that you are one of
      those fools of feeling,&mdash;those professors of anti-revolutionary
      virtue, of whom I have seen not a few before my Bar. Faugh! it sickens me
      to see those who make a merit of incivism, and perish to save some bad
      patriot, because it is a son, or a father, or a wife, or a daughter, who
      is saved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I AM one of those fools of feeling,&rdquo; said the stranger, rising. &ldquo;You have
      divined aright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wilt thou not, in return for my mercy, utter to-night the revelations
      thou wouldst proclaim to-morrow? Come; and perhaps thou too&mdash;nay, the
      woman also&mdash;may receive, not reprieve, but pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before your tribunal, and there alone! Nor will I deceive you, president.
      My information may avail you not; and even while I show the cloud, the
      bolt may fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tush! prophet, look to thyself! Go, madman, go. I know too well the
      contumacious obstinacy of the class to which I suspect thou belongest, to
      waste further words. Diable! but ye grow so accustomed to look on death,
      that ye forget the respect ye owe to it. Since thou offerest me thy head,
      I accept it. To-morrow thou mayst repent; it will be too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, too late, president!&rdquo; echoed the calm visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, remember, it is not pardon, it is but a day&rsquo;s reprieve, I have
      promised to this woman. According as thou dost satisfy me to-morrow, she
      lives or dies. I am frank, citizen; thy ghost shall not haunt me for want
      of faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is but a day that I have asked; the rest I leave to justice and to
      Heaven. Your huissiers wait below.&rdquo;

</pre>
    <p>
      Viola was in the prison that opened not but for those already condemned
      before adjudged. Since her exile from Zanoni, her very intellect had
      seemed paralysed. All that beautiful exuberance of fancy which, if not the
      fruit of genius, seemed its blossoms; all that gush of exquisite thought
      which Zanoni had justly told her flowed with mysteries and subtleties ever
      new to him, the wise one,&mdash;all were gone, annihilated; the blossom
      withered, the fount dried up. From something almost above womanhood, she
      seemed listlessly to sink into something below childhood. With the
      inspirer the inspirations had ceased; and, in deserting love, genius also
      was left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She scarcely comprehended why she had been thus torn from her home and the
      mechanism of her dull tasks. She scarcely knew what meant those kindly
      groups, that, struck with her exceeding loveliness, had gathered round her
      in the prison, with mournful looks, but with words of comfort. She, who
      had hitherto been taught to abhor those whom Law condemns for crime, was
      amazed to hear that beings thus compassionate and tender, with cloudless
      and lofty brows, with gallant and gentle mien, were criminals for whom Law
      had no punishment short of death. But they, the savages, gaunt and
      menacing, who had dragged her from her home, who had attempted to snatch
      from her the infant while she clasped it in her arms, and laughed fierce
      scorn at her mute, quivering lips,&mdash;THEY were the chosen citizens,
      the men of virtue, the favourites of Power, the ministers of Law! Such thy
      black caprices, O thou, the ever-shifting and calumnious,&mdash;Human
      Judgment!
    </p>
    <p>
      A squalid, and yet a gay world, did the prison-houses of that day present.
      There, as in the sepulchre to which they led, all ranks were cast with an
      even-handed scorn. And yet there, the reverence that comes from great
      emotions restored Nature&rsquo;s first and imperishable, and most lovely, and
      most noble Law,&mdash;THE INEQUALITY BETWEEN MAN AND MAN! There, place was
      given by the prisoners, whether royalists or sans-culottes, to Age, to
      Learning, to Renown, to Beauty; and Strength, with its own inborn
      chivalry, raised into rank the helpless and the weak. The iron sinews and
      the Herculean shoulders made way for the woman and the child; and the
      graces of Humanity, lost elsewhere, sought their refuge in the abode of
      Terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wherefore, my child, do they bring thee hither?&rdquo; asked an old,
      grey-haired priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, if you know not your offence, fear the worst!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my child?&rdquo;&mdash;for the infant was still suffered to rest upon her
      bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, young mother, they will suffer thy child to live.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for this,&mdash;an orphan in the dungeon!&rdquo; murmured the accusing
      heart of Viola,&mdash;&ldquo;have I reserved his offspring! Zanoni, even in
      thought, ask not&mdash;ask not what I have done with the child I bore
      thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Night came; the crowd rushed to the grate to hear the muster-roll.
      (Called, in the mocking jargon of the day, &ldquo;The Evening Gazette.&rdquo;) Her
      name was with the doomed. And the old priest, better prepared to die, but
      reserved from the death-list, laid his hands on her head, and blessed her
      while he wept. She heard, and wondered; but she did not weep. With
      downcast eyes, with arms folded on her bosom, she bent submissively to the
      call. But now another name was uttered; and a man, who had pushed rudely
      past her to gaze or to listen, shrieked out a howl of despair and rage.
      She turned, and their eyes met. Through the distance of time she
      recognised that hideous aspect. Nicot&rsquo;s face settled back into its
      devilish sneer. &ldquo;At least, gentle Neapolitan, the guillotine will unite
      us. Oh, we shall sleep well our wedding-night!&rdquo; And, with a laugh, he
      strode away through the crowd, and vanished into his lair.
    </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      She was placed in her gloomy cell, to await the morrow. But the child was
      still spared her; and she thought it seemed as if conscious of the awful
      present. In their way to the prison it had not moaned or wept. It had
      looked with its clear eyes, unshrinking, on the gleaming pikes and savage
      brows of the huissiers. And now, alone in the dungeon, it put its arms
      round her neck, and murmured its indistinct sounds, low and sweet as some
      unknown language of consolation and of heaven. And of heaven it was!&mdash;for,
      at the murmur, the terror melted from her soul; upward, from the dungeon
      and the death,&mdash;upward, where the happy cherubim chant the mercy of
      the All-loving, whispered that cherub&rsquo;s voice. She fell upon her knees and
      prayed. The despoilers of all that beautifies and hallows life had
      desecrated the altar, and denied the God!&mdash;they had removed from the
      last hour of their victims the Priest, the Scripture, and the Cross! But
      Faith builds in the dungeon and the lazar-house its sublimest shrines; and
      up, through roofs of stone, that shut out the eye of Heaven, ascends the
      ladder where the angels glide to and fro,&mdash;PRAYER.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there, in the very cell beside her own, the atheist Nicot sits stolid
      amidst the darkness, and hugs the thought of Danton, that death is
      nothingness. (&ldquo;Ma demeure sera bientot LE NEANT&rdquo; (My abode will soon be
      nothingness), said Danton before his judges.)) His, no spectacle of an
      appalled and perturbed conscience! Remorse is the echo of a lost virtue,
      and virtue he never knew. Had he to live again, he would live the same.
      But more terrible than the death-bed of a believing and despairing sinner
      that blank gloom of apathy,&mdash;that contemplation of the worm and the
      rat of the charnel-house; that grim and loathsome NOTHINGNESS which, for
      his eye, falls like a pall over the universe of life. Still, staring into
      space, gnawing his livid lip, he looks upon the darkness, convinced that
      darkness is forever and forever!
    </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      Place, there! place! Room yet in your crowded cells. Another has come to
      the slaughter-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the jailer, lamp in hand, ushered in the stranger, the latter touched
      him and whispered. The stranger drew a jewel from his finger. Diantre, how
      the diamond flashed in the ray of the lamp! Value each head of your eighty
      at a thousand francs, and the jewel is more worth than all! The jailer
      paused, and the diamond laughed in his dazzled eyes. O thou Cerberus, thou
      hast mastered all else that seems human in that fell employ! Thou hast no
      pity, no love, and no remorse. But Avarice survives the rest, and the foul
      heart&rsquo;s master-serpent swallows up the tribe. Ha! ha! crafty stranger,
      thou hast conquered! They tread the gloomy corridor; they arrive at the
      door where the jailer has placed the fatal mark, now to be erased, for the
      prisoner within is to be reprieved a day. The key grates in the lock; the
      door yawns,&mdash;the stranger takes the lamp and enters.

      And Viola was in prayer. She heard not the opening of the door; she saw
      not the dark shadow that fell along the floor. HIS power, HIS arts were
      gone; but the mystery and the spell known to HER simple heart did not
      desert her in the hours of trial and despair. When Science falls as a
      firework from the sky it would invade; when Genius withers as a flower in
      the breath of the icy charnel,&mdash;the hope of a child-like soul wraps
      the air in light, and the innocence of unquestioning Belief covers the
      grave with blossoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the farthest corner of the cell she knelt; and the infant, as if to
      imitate what it could not comprehend, bent its little limbs, and bowed its
      smiling face, and knelt with her also, by her side.

      He stood and gazed upon them as the light of the lamp fell calmly on their
      forms. It fell over those clouds of golden hair, dishevelled, parted,
      thrown back from the rapt, candid brow; the dark eyes raised on high,
      where, through the human tears, a light as from above was mirrored; the
      hands clasped, the lips apart, the form all animate and holy with the sad
      serenity of innocence and the touching humility of woman. And he heard her
      voice, though it scarcely left her lips: the low voice that the heart
      speaks,&mdash;loud enough for God to hear!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if never more to see him, O Father! Canst Thou not make the love that
      will not die, minister, even beyond the grave, to his earthly fate? Canst
      Thou not yet permit it, as a living spirit, to hover over him,&mdash;a
      spirit fairer than all his science can conjure? Oh, whatever lot be
      ordained to either, grant&mdash;even though a thousand ages may roll
      between us&mdash;grant, when at last purified and regenerate, and fitted
      for the transport of such reunion&mdash;grant that we may meet once more!
      And for his child,&mdash;it kneels to Thee from the dungeon floor!
      To-morrow, and whose breast shall cradle it; whose hand shall feed; whose
      lips shall pray for its weal below and its soul hereafter!&rdquo; She paused,&mdash;her
      voice choked with sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou Viola!&mdash;thou, thyself. He whom thou hast deserted is here to
      preserve the mother to the child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started!&mdash;those accents, tremulous as her own! She started to her
      feet!&mdash;he was there,&mdash;in all the pride of his unwaning youth and
      superhuman beauty; there, in the house of dread, and in the hour of
      travail; there, image and personation of the love that can pierce the
      Valley of the Shadow, and can glide, the unscathed wanderer from the
      heaven, through the roaring abyss of hell!
    </p>
    <p>
      With a cry never, perhaps, heard before in that gloomy vault,&mdash;a cry
      of delight and rapture, she sprang forward, and fell at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent down to raise her; but she slid from his arms. He called her by
      the familiar epithets of the old endearment, and she only answered him by
      sobs. Wildly, passionately, she kissed his hands, the hem of his garment,
      but voice was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look up, look up!&mdash;I am here,&mdash;I am here to save thee! Wilt
      thou deny to me thy sweet face? Truant, wouldst thou fly me still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fly thee!&rdquo; she said, at last, and in a broken voice; &ldquo;oh, if my thoughts
      wronged thee,&mdash;oh, if my dream, that awful dream, deceived,&mdash;kneel
      down with me, and pray for our child!&rdquo; Then springing to her feet with a
      sudden impulse, she caught up the infant, and, placing it in his arms,
      sobbed forth, with deprecating and humble tones, &ldquo;Not for my sake,&mdash;not
      for mine, did I abandon thee, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Zanoni; &ldquo;I know all the thoughts that thy confused and
      struggling senses can scarcely analyse themselves. And see how, with a
      look, thy child answers them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in truth the face of that strange infant seemed radiant with its
      silent and unfathomable joy. It seemed as if it recognised the father; it
      clung&mdash;it forced itself to his breast, and there, nestling, turned
      its bright, clear eyes upon Viola, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray for my child!&rdquo; said Zanoni, mournfully. &ldquo;The thoughts of souls that
      would aspire as mine are All PRAYER!&rdquo; And, seating himself by her side, he
      began to reveal to her some of the holier secrets of his lofty being. He
      spoke of the sublime and intense faith from which alone the diviner
      knowledge can arise,&mdash;the faith which, seeing the immortal
      everywhere, purifies and exalts the mortal that beholds, the glorious
      ambition that dwells not in the cabals and crimes of earth, but amidst
      those solemn wonders that speak not of men, but of God; of that power to
      abstract the soul from the clay which gives to the eye of the soul its
      subtle vision, and to the soul&rsquo;s wing the unlimited realm; of that pure,
      severe, and daring initiation from which the mind emerges, as from death,
      into clear perceptions of its kindred with the Father-Principles of life
      and light, so that in its own sense of the Beautiful it finds its joy; in
      the serenity of its will, its power; in its sympathy with the youthfulness
      of the Infinite Creation, of which itself is an essence and a part, the
      secrets that embalm the very clay which they consecrate, and renew the
      strength of life with the ambrosia of mysterious and celestial sleep. And
      while he spoke, Viola listened, breathless. If she could not comprehend,
      she no longer dared to distrust. She felt that in that enthusiasm,
      self-deceiving or not, no fiend could lurk; and by an intuition, rather
      than an effort of the reason, she saw before her, like a starry ocean, the
      depth and mysterious beauty of the soul which her fears had wronged. Yet,
      when he said (concluding his strange confessions) that to this life WITHIN
      life and ABOVE life he had dreamed to raise her own, the fear of humanity
      crept over her, and he read in her silence how vain, with all his science,
      would the dream have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, as he closed, and, leaning on his breast, she felt the clasp of
      his protecting arms,&mdash;when, in one holy kiss, the past was forgiven
      and the present lost,&mdash;then there returned to her the sweet and warm
      hopes of the natural life, of the loving woman. He was come to save her!
      She asked not how,&mdash;she believed it without a question. They should
      be at last again united. They would fly far from those scenes of violence
      and blood. Their happy Ionian isle, their fearless solitudes, would once
      more receive them. She laughed, with a child&rsquo;s joy, as this picture rose
      up amidst the gloom of the dungeon. Her mind, faithful to its sweet,
      simple instincts, refused to receive the lofty images that flitted
      confusedly by it, and settled back to its human visions, yet more
      baseless, of the earthly happiness and the tranquil home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk not now to me, beloved,&mdash;talk not more now to me of the past!
      Thou art here,&mdash;thou wilt save me; we shall live yet the common happy
      life, that life with thee is happiness and glory enough to me. Traverse,
      if thou wilt, in thy pride of soul, the universe; thy heart again is the
      universe to mine. I thought but now that I was prepared to die; I see
      thee, touch thee, and again I know how beautiful a thing is life! See
      through the grate the stars are fading from the sky; the morrow will soon
      be here,&mdash;The MORROW which will open the prison doors! Thou sayest
      thou canst save me,&mdash;I will not doubt it now. Oh, let us dwell no
      more in cities! I never doubted thee in our lovely isle; no dreams haunted
      me there, except dreams of joy and beauty; and thine eyes made yet more
      beautiful and joyous the world in waking. To-morrow!&mdash;why do you not
      smile? To-morrow, love! is not TO-MORROW a blessed word! Cruel! you would
      punish me still, that you will not share my joy. Aha! see our little one,
      how it laughs to my eyes! I will talk to THAT. Child, thy father is come
      back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And taking the infant in her arms, and seating herself at a little
      distance, she rocked it to and fro on her bosom, and prattled to it, and
      kissed it between every word, and laughed and wept by fits, as ever and
      anon she cast over her shoulder her playful, mirthful glance upon the
      father to whom those fading stars smiled sadly their last farewell. How
      beautiful she seemed as she thus sat, unconscious of the future! Still
      half a child herself, her child laughing to her laughter,&mdash;two soft
      triflers on the brink of the grave! Over her throat, as she bent, fell,
      like a golden cloud, her redundant hair; it covered her treasure like a
      veil of light, and the child&rsquo;s little hands put it aside from time to
      time, to smile through the parted tresses, and then to cover its face and
      peep and smile again. It were cruel to damp that joy, more cruel still to
      share it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Viola,&rdquo; said Zanoni, at last, &ldquo;dost thou remember that, seated by the
      cave on the moonlit beach, in our bridal isle, thou once didst ask me for
      this amulet?&mdash;the charm of a superstition long vanished from the
      world, with the creed to which it belonged. It is the last relic of my
      native land, and my mother, on her deathbed, placed it round my neck. I
      told thee then I would give it thee on that day WHEN THE LAWS OF OUR BEING
      SHOULD BECOME THE SAME.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember it well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow it shall be thine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that dear to-morrow!&rdquo; And, gently laying down her child,&mdash;for it
      slept now,&mdash;she threw herself on his breast, and pointed to the dawn
      that began greyly to creep along the skies.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, in those horror-breathing walls, the day-star looked through the
      dismal bars upon those three beings, in whom were concentrated whatever is
      most tender in human ties; whatever is most mysterious in the combinations
      of the human mind; the sleeping Innocence; the trustful Affection, that,
      contented with a touch, a breath, can foresee no sorrow; the weary Science
      that, traversing all the secrets of creation, comes at last to Death for
      their solution, and still clings, as it nears the threshold, to the breast
      of Love. Thus, within, THE WITHIN,&mdash;a dungeon; without, the WITHOUT,&mdash;stately
      with marts and halls, with palaces and temples; Revenge and Terror, at
      their dark schemes and counter-schemes; to and fro, upon the tide of the
      shifting passions, reeled the destinies of men and nations; and hard at
      hand that day-star, waning into space, looked with impartial eye on the
      church tower and the guillotine. Up springs the blithesome morn. In yon
      gardens the birds renew their familiar song. The fishes are sporting
      through the freshening waters of the Seine. The gladness of divine nature,
      the roar and dissonance of mortal life, awake again: the trader unbars his
      windows; the flower-girls troop gayly to their haunts; busy feet are
      tramping to the daily drudgeries that revolutions which strike down kings
      and kaisars, leave the same Cain&rsquo;s heritage to the boor; the wagons groan
      and reel to the mart; Tyranny, up betimes, holds its pallid levee;
      Conspiracy, that hath not slept, hears the clock, and whispers to its own
      heart, &ldquo;The hour draws near.&rdquo; A group gather, eager-eyed, round the
      purlieus of the Convention Hall; to-day decides the sovereignty of France,&mdash;about
      the courts of the Tribunal their customary hum and stir. No matter what
      the hazard of the die, or who the ruler, this day eighty heads shall fall!
    </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      And she slept so sweetly. Wearied out with joy, secure in the presence of
      the eyes regained, she had laughed and wept herself to sleep; and still in
      that slumber there seemed a happy consciousness that the loved was by,&mdash;the
      lost was found. For she smiled and murmured to herself, and breathed his
      name often, and stretched out her arms, and sighed if they touched him
      not. He gazed upon her as he stood apart,&mdash;with what emotions it were
      vain to say. She would wake no more to him; she could not know how dearly
      the safety of that sleep was purchased. That morrow she had so yearned
      for,&mdash;it had come at last. HOW WOULD SHE GREET THE EVE? Amidst all
      the exquisite hopes with which love and youth contemplate the future, her
      eyes had closed. Those hopes still lent their iris-colours to her dreams.
      She would wake to live! To-morrow, and the Reign of Terror was no more;
      the prison gates would be opened,&mdash;she would go forth, with their
      child, into that summer-world of light. And HE?&mdash;he turned, and his
      eye fell upon the child; it was broad awake, and that clear, serious,
      thoughtful look which it mostly wore, watched him with a solemn
      steadiness. He bent over and kissed its lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never more,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;O heritor of love and grief,&mdash;never more
      wilt thou see me in thy visions; never more will the light of those eyes
      be fed by celestial commune; never more can my soul guard from thy pillow
      the trouble and the disease. Not such as I would have vainly shaped it,
      must be thy lot. In common with thy race, it must be thine to suffer, to
      struggle, and to err. But mild be thy human trials, and strong be thy
      spirit to love and to believe! And thus, as I gaze upon thee,&mdash;thus
      may my nature breathe into thine its last and most intense desire; may my
      love for thy mother pass to thee, and in thy looks may she hear my spirit
      comfort and console her. Hark! they come! Yes! I await ye both beyond the
      grave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door slowly opened; the jailer appeared, and through the aperture
      rushed, at the same instant, a ray of sunlight: it streamed over the fair,
      hushed face of the happy sleeper,&mdash;it played like a smile upon the
      lips of the child that, still, mute, and steadfast, watched the movements
      of its father. At that moment Viola muttered in her sleep, &ldquo;The day is
      come,&mdash;the gates are open! Give me thy hand; we will go forth! To
      sea, to sea! How the sunshine plays upon the waters!&mdash;to home,
      beloved one, to home again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Citizen, thine hour is come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hist! she sleeps! A moment! There, it is done! thank Heaven!&mdash;and
      STILL she sleeps!&rdquo; He would not kiss, lest he should awaken her, but
      gently placed round her neck the amulet that would speak to her,
      hereafter, the farewell,&mdash;and promise, in that farewell, reunion! He
      is at the threshold,&mdash;he turns again, and again. The door closes! He
      is gone forever!
    </p>
    <p>
      She woke at last,&mdash;she gazed round. &ldquo;Zanoni, it is day!&rdquo; No answer
      but the low wail of her child. Merciful Heaven! was it then all a dream?
      She tossed back the long tresses that must veil her sight; she felt the
      amulet on her bosom,&mdash;it was NO dream! &ldquo;O God! and he is gone!&rdquo; She
      sprang to the door,&mdash;she shrieked aloud. The jailer comes. &ldquo;My
      husband, my child&rsquo;s father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is gone before thee, woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whither? Speak&mdash;speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the guillotine!&rdquo;&mdash;and the black door closed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It closed upon the senseless! As a lightning-flash, Zanoni&rsquo;s words, his
      sadness, the true meaning of his mystic gift, the very sacrifice he made
      for her, all became distinct for a moment to her mind,&mdash;and then
      darkness swept on it like a storm, yet darkness which had its light. And
      while she sat there, mute, rigid, voiceless, as congealed to stone, A
      VISION, like a wind, glided over the deeps within,&mdash;the grim court,
      the judge, the jury, the accuser; and amidst the victims the one dauntless
      and radiant form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou knowest the danger to the State,&mdash;confess!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know; and I keep my promise. Judge, I reveal thy doom! I know that the
      Anarchy thou callest a State expires with the setting of this sun. Hark,
      to the tramp without; hark to the roar of voices! Room there, ye dead!&mdash;room
      in hell for Robespierre and his crew!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They hurry into the court,&mdash;the hasty and pale messengers; there is
      confusion and fear and dismay! &ldquo;Off with the conspirator, and to-morrow
      the woman thou wouldst have saved shall die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, president, the steel falls on THEE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On, through the crowded and roaring streets, on moves the Procession of
      Death. Ha, brave people! thou art aroused at last. They shall not die!
      Death is dethroned!&mdash;Robespierre has fallen!&mdash;they rush to the
      rescue! Hideous in the tumbril, by the side of Zanoni, raved and
      gesticulated that form which, in his prophetic dreams, he had seen his
      companion at the place of death. &ldquo;Save us!&mdash;save us!&rdquo; howled the
      atheist Nicot. &ldquo;On, brave populace! we SHALL be saved!&rdquo; And through the
      crowd, her dark hair streaming wild, her eyes flashing fire, pressed a
      female form, &ldquo;My Clarence!&rdquo; she shrieked, in the soft Southern language
      native to the ears of Viola; &ldquo;butcher! what hast thou done with Clarence?&rdquo;
       Her eyes roved over the eager faces of the prisoners; she saw not the one
      she sought. &ldquo;Thank Heaven!&mdash;thank Heaven! I am not thy murderess!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nearer and nearer press the populace,&mdash;another moment, and the
      deathsman is defrauded. O Zanoni! why still upon THY brow the resignation
      that speaks no hope? Tramp! tramp! through the streets dash the armed
      troop; faithful to his orders, Black Henriot leads them on. Tramp! tramp!
      over the craven and scattered crowd! Here, flying in disorder,&mdash;there,
      trampled in the mire, the shrieking rescuers! And amidst them, stricken by
      the sabres of the guard, her long hair blood-bedabbled, lies the Italian
      woman; and still upon her writhing lips sits joy, as they murmur,
      &ldquo;Clarence! I have not destroyed thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On to the Barriere du Trone. It frowns dark in the air,&mdash;the giant
      instrument of murder! One after one to the glaive,&mdash;another and
      another and another! Mercy! O mercy! Is the bridge between the sun and the
      shades so brief,&mdash;brief as a sigh? There, there,&mdash;HIS turn has
      come. &ldquo;Die not yet; leave me not behind; hear me&mdash;hear me!&rdquo; shrieked
      the inspired sleeper. &ldquo;What! and thou smilest still!&rdquo; They smiled,&mdash;those
      pale lips,&mdash;and WITH the smile, the place of doom, the headsman, the
      horror vanished. With that smile, all space seemed suffused in eternal
      sunshine. Up from the earth he rose; he hovered over her,&mdash;a thing
      not of matter, an IDEA of joy and light! Behind, Heaven opened, deep after
      deep; and the Hosts of Beauty were seen, rank upon rank, afar; and
      &ldquo;Welcome!&rdquo; in a myriad melodies, broke from your choral multitude, ye
      People of the Skies,&mdash;&ldquo;welcome! O purified by sacrifice, and immortal
      only through the grave,&mdash;this it is to die.&rdquo; And radiant amidst the
      radiant, the IMAGE stretched forth its arms, and murmured to the sleeper:
      &ldquo;Companion of Eternity!&mdash;THIS it is to die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! wherefore do they make us signs from the house-tops? Wherefore gather
      the crowds through the street? Why sounds the bell? Why shrieks the
      tocsin? Hark to the guns!&mdash;the armed clash! Fellow-captives, is there
      hope for us at last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So gasp out the prisoners, each to each. Day wanes&mdash;evening closes;
      still they press their white faces to the bars, and still from window and
      from house-top they see the smiles of friends,&mdash;the waving signals!
      &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; at last,&mdash;&ldquo;Hurrah! Robespierre is fallen! The Reign of
      Terror is no more! God hath permitted us to live!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes; cast thine eyes into the hall where the tyrant and his conclave
      hearkened to the roar without! Fulfilling the prophecy of Dumas, Henriot,
      drunk with blood and alcohol, reels within, and chucks his gory sabre on
      the floor. &ldquo;All is lost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretch! thy cowardice hath destroyed us!&rdquo; yelled the fierce Coffinhal, as
      he hurled the coward from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calm as despair stands the stern St. Just; the palsied Couthon crawls,
      grovelling, beneath table; a shot,&mdash;an explosion! Robespierre would
      destroy himself! The trembling hand has mangled, and failed to kill! The
      clock of the Hotel de Ville strikes the third hour. Through the battered
      door, along the gloomy passages, into the Death-hall, burst the crowd.
      Mangled, livid, blood-stained, speechless but not unconscious, sits
      haughty yet, in his seat erect, the Master-Murderer! Around him they
      throng; they hoot,&mdash;they execrate, their faces gleaming in the
      tossing torches! HE, and not the starry Magian, the REAL Sorcerer! And
      round HIS last hours gather the Fiends he raised!
    </p>
    <p>
      They drag him forth! Open thy gates, inexorable prison! The Conciergerie
      receives its prey! Never a word again on earth spoke Maximilien
      Robespierre! Pour forth thy thousands, and tens of thousands, emancipated
      Paris! To the Place de la Revolution rolls the tumbril of the King of
      Terror,&mdash;St. Just, Dumas, Couthon, his companions to the grave! A
      woman&mdash;a childless woman, with hoary hair&mdash;springs to his side,
      &ldquo;Thy death makes me drunk with joy!&rdquo; He opened his bloodshot eyes,&mdash;&ldquo;Descend
      to hell with the curses of wives and mothers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The headsmen wrench the rag from the shattered jaw; a shriek, and the
      crowd laugh, and the axe descends amidst the shout of the countless
      thousands, and blackness rushes on thy soul, Maximilien Robespierre! So
      ended the Reign of Terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      ....
    </p>
    <p>
      Daylight in the prison. From cell to cell they hurry with the news,&mdash;crowd
      upon crowd; the joyous captives mingled with the very jailers, who, for
      fear, would fain seem joyous too; they stream through the dens and alleys
      of the grim house they will shortly leave. They burst into a cell,
      forgotten since the previous morning. They found there a young female,
      sitting upon her wretched bed; her arms crossed upon her bosom, her face
      raised upward; the eyes unclosed, and a smile of more than serenity&mdash;of
      bliss&mdash;upon her lips. Even in the riot of their joy, they drew back
      in astonishment and awe. Never had they seen life so beautiful; and as
      they crept nearer, and with noiseless feet, they saw that the lips
      breathed not, that the repose was of marble, that the beauty and the
      ecstasy were of death. They gathered round in silence; and lo! at her feet
      there was a young infant, who, wakened by their tread, looked at them
      steadfastly, and with its rosy fingers played with its dead mother&rsquo;s robe.
      An orphan there in a dungeon vault!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor one!&rdquo; said a female (herself a parent), &ldquo;and they say the father
      fell yesterday; and now the mother! Alone in the world, what can be its
      fate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The infant smiled fearlessly on the crowd, as the woman spoke thus. And
      the old priest, who stood amongst them, said gently, &ldquo;Woman, see! the
      orphan smiles! THE FATHERLESS ARE THE CARE OF GOD!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      NOTE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The curiosity which Zanoni has excited among those who think it worth while
      to dive into the subtler meanings they believe it intended to convey, may
      excuse me in adding a few words, not in explanation of its mysteries, but
      upon the principles which permit them. Zanoni is not, as some have
      supposed, an allegory; but beneath the narrative it relates, TYPICAL
      meanings are concealed. It is to be regarded in two characters, distinct
      yet harmonious,&mdash;1st, that of the simple and objective fiction, in
      which (once granting the license of the author to select a subject which
      is, or appears to be, preternatural) the reader judges the writer by the
      usual canons,&mdash;namely, by the consistency of his characters under
      such admitted circumstances, the interest of his story, and the coherence
      of his plot; of the work regarded in this view, it is not my intention to
      say anything, whether in exposition of the design, or in defence of the
      execution. No typical meanings (which, in plain terms are but moral
      suggestions, more or less numerous, more or less subtle) can afford just
      excuse to a writer of fiction, for the errors he should avoid in the most
      ordinary novel. We have no right to expect the most ingenious reader to
      search for the inner meaning, if the obvious course of the narrative be
      tedious and displeasing. It is, on the contrary, in proportion as we are
      satisfied with the objective sense of a work of imagination, that we are
      inclined to search into its depths for the more secret intentions of the
      author. Were we not so divinely charmed with &ldquo;Faust,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Prometheus,&rdquo; so ardently carried on by the interest of the story told to
      the common understanding, we should trouble ourselves little with the
      types in each which all of us can detect,&mdash;none of us can elucidate;
      none elucidate, for the essence of type is mystery. We behold the figure,
      we cannot lift the veil. The author himself is not called upon to explain
      what he designed. An allegory is a personation of distinct and definite
      things,&mdash;virtues or qualities,&mdash;and the key can be given easily;
      but a writer who conveys typical meanings, may express them in myriads. He
      cannot disentangle all the hues which commingle into the light he seeks to
      cast upon truth; and therefore the great masters of this enchanted soil,&mdash;Fairyland
      of Fairyland, Poetry imbedded beneath Poetry,&mdash;wisely leave to each
      mind to guess at such truths as best please or instruct it. To have asked
      Goethe to explain the &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; would have entailed as complex and puzzling
      an answer as to have asked Mephistopheles to explain what is beneath the
      earth we tread on. The stores beneath may differ for every passenger; each
      step may require a new description; and what is treasure to the geologist
      may be rubbish to the miner. Six worlds may lie under a sod, but to the
      common eye they are but six layers of stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Art in itself, if not necessarily typical, is essentially a suggester of
      something subtler than that which it embodies to the sense. What Pliny
      tells us of a great painter of old, is true of most great painters; &ldquo;their
      works express something beyond the works,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;more felt than
      understood.&rdquo; This belongs to the concentration of intellect which high art
      demands, and which, of all the arts, sculpture best illustrates. Take
      Thorwaldsen&rsquo;s Statue of Mercury,&mdash;it is but a single figure, yet it
      tells to those conversant with mythology a whole legend. The god has
      removed the pipe from his lips, because he has already lulled to sleep the
      Argus, whom you do not see. He is pressing his heel against his sword,
      because the moment is come when he may slay his victim. Apply the
      principle of this noble concentration of art to the moral writer: he, too,
      gives to your eye but a single figure; yet each attitude, each expression,
      may refer to events and truths you must have the learning to remember, the
      acuteness to penetrate, or the imagination to conjecture. But to a
      classical judge of sculpture, would not the exquisite pleasure of
      discovering the all not told in Thorwaldsen&rsquo;s masterpiece be destroyed if
      the artist had engraved in detail his meaning at the base of the statue?
      Is it not the same with the typical sense which the artist in words
      conveys? The pleasure of divining art in each is the noble exercise of all
      by whom art is worthily regarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      We of the humbler race not unreasonably shelter ourselves under the
      authority of the masters, on whom the world&rsquo;s judgment is pronounced; and
      great names are cited, not with the arrogance of equals, but with the
      humility of inferiors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The author of Zanoni gives, then, no key to mysteries, be they trivial or
      important, which may be found in the secret chambers by those who lift the
      tapestry from the wall; but out of the many solutions of the main enigma&mdash;if
      enigma, indeed, there be&mdash;which have been sent to him, he ventures to
      select the one which he subjoins, from the ingenuity and thought which it
      displays, and from respect for the distinguished writer (one of the most
      eminent our time has produced) who deemed him worthy of an honour he is
      proud to display. He leaves it to the reader to agree with, or dissent
      from the explanation. &ldquo;A hundred men,&rdquo; says the old Platonist, &ldquo;may read
      the book by the help of the same lamp, yet all may differ on the text, for
      the lamp only lights the characters,&mdash;the mind must divine the
      meaning.&rdquo; The object of a parable is not that of a problem; it does not
      seek to convince, but to suggest. It takes the thought below the surface
      of the understanding to the deeper intelligence which the world rarely
      tasks. It is not sunlight on the water; it is a hymn chanted to the nymph
      who hearkens and awakes below.

    <h2>
      &ldquo;ZANONI EXPLAINED.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BY&mdash;.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      MEJNOUR:&mdash;Contemplation of the Actual,&mdash;SCIENCE. Always old, and
      must last as long as the Actual. Less fallible than Idealism, but less
      practically potent, from its ignorance of the human heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      ZANONI:&mdash;Contemplation of the Ideal,&mdash;IDEALISM. Always
      necessarily sympathetic: lives by enjoyment; and is therefore typified by
      eternal youth. (&ldquo;I do not understand the making Idealism less undying (on
      this scene of existence) than Science.&rdquo;&mdash;Commentator. Because,
      granting the above premises, Idealism is more subjected than Science to
      the Affections, or to Instinct, because the Affections, sooner or later,
      force Idealism into the Actual, and in the Actual its immortality departs.
      The only absolutely Actual portion of the work is found in the concluding
      scenes that depict the Reign of Terror. The introduction of this part was
      objected to by some as out of keeping with the fanciful portions that
      preceded it. But if the writer of the solution has rightly shown or
      suggested the intention of the author, the most strongly and rudely actual
      scene of the age in which the story is cast was the necessary and
      harmonious completion of the whole. The excesses and crimes of Humanity
      are the grave of the Ideal.&mdash;Author.) Idealism is the potent
      Interpreter and Prophet of the Real; but its powers are impaired in
      proportion to their exposure to human passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      VIOLA:&mdash;Human INSTINCT. (Hardly worthy to be called LOVE, as Love
      would not forsake its object at the bidding of Superstition.) Resorts,
      first in its aspiration after the Ideal, to tinsel shows; then
      relinquishes these for a higher love; but is still, from the conditions of
      its nature, inadequate to this, and liable to suspicion and mistrust. Its
      greatest force (Maternal Instinct) has power to penetrate some secrets, to
      trace some movements of the Ideal, but, too feeble to command them, yields
      to Superstition, sees sin where there is none, while committing sin, under
      a false guidance; weakly seeking refuge amidst the very tumults of the
      warring passions of the Actual, while deserting the serene Ideal,&mdash;pining,
      nevertheless, in the absence of the Ideal, and expiring (not perishing,
      but becoming transmuted) in the aspiration after having the laws of the
      two natures reconciled.
    </p>
    <p>
      (It might best suit popular apprehension to call these three the
      Understanding, the Imagination, and the Heart.)
    </p>
    <p>
      CHILD:&mdash;NEW-BORN INSTINCT, while trained and informed by Idealism,
      promises a preter-human result by its early, incommunicable vigilance and
      intelligence, but is compelled, by inevitable orphanhood, and the one-half
      of the laws of its existence, to lapse into ordinary conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      AIDON-AI:&mdash;FAITH, which manifests its splendour, and delivers its
      oracles, and imparts its marvels, only to the higher moods of the soul,
      and whose directed antagonism is with Fear; so that those who employ the
      resources of Fear must dispense with those of Faith. Yet aspiration holds
      open a way of restoration, and may summon Faith, even when the cry issues
      from beneath the yoke of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      DWELLER OF THE THRESHOLD:&mdash;FEAR (or HORROR), from whose ghastliness
      men are protected by the opacity of the region of Prescription and Custom.
      The moment this protection is relinquished, and the human spirit pierces
      the cloud, and enters alone on the unexplored regions of Nature, this
      Natural Horror haunts it, and is to be successfully encountered only by
      defiance,&mdash;by aspiration towards, and reliance on, the Former and
      Director of Nature, whose Messenger and Instrument of reassurance is
      Faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      MERVALE:&mdash;CONVENTIONALISM.
    </p>
    <p>
      NICOT:&mdash;Base, grovelling, malignant PASSION.
    </p>
    <p>
      GLYNDON:&mdash;UNSUSTAINED ASPIRATION: Would follow Instinct, but is
      deterred by Conventionalism, is overawed by Idealism, yet attracted, and
      transiently inspired, but has not steadiness for the initiatory
      contemplation of the Actual. He conjoins its snatched privileges with a
      besetting sensualism, and suffers at once from the horror of the one and
      the disgust of the other, involving the innocent in the fatal conflict of
      his spirit. When on the point of perishing, he is rescued by Idealism,
      and, unable to rise to that species of existence, is grateful to be
      replunged into the region of the Familiar, and takes up his rest
      henceforth in Custom. (Mirror of Young Manhood.)
    </p>
    <p>
      .... ARGUMENT.
    </p>
    <p>
      Human Existence subject to, and exempt from, ordinary conditions
      (Sickness, Poverty, Ignorance, Death).
    </p>
    <p>
      SCIENCE is ever striving to carry the most gifted beyond ordinary
      conditions,&mdash;the result being as many victims as efforts, and the
      striver being finally left a solitary,&mdash;for his object is unsuitable
      to the natures he has to deal with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pursuit of the Ideal involves so much emotion as to render the
      Idealist vulnerable by human passion, however long and well guarded, still
      vulnerable,&mdash;liable, at last, to a union with Instinct. Passion
      obscures both Insight and Forecast. All effort to elevate Instinct to
      Idealism is abortive, the laws of their being not coinciding (in the early
      stage of the existence of the one). Instinct is either alarmed, and takes
      refuge in Superstition or Custom, or is left helpless to human charity, or
      given over to providential care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Idealism, stripped of in sight and forecast, loses its serenity, becomes
      subject once more to the horror from which it had escaped, and by
      accepting its aids, forfeits the higher help of Faith; aspiration,
      however, remaining still possible, and, thereby, slow restoration; and
      also, SOMETHING BETTER.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summoned by aspiration, Faith extorts from Fear itself the saving truth to
      which Science continues blind, and which Idealism itself hails as its
      crowning acquisition,&mdash;the inestimable PROOF wrought out by all
      labours and all conflicts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pending the elaboration of this proof,
    </p>
    <p>
      CONVENTIONALISM plods on, safe and complacent;
    </p>
    <p>
      SELFISH PASSION perishes, grovelling and hopeless;
    </p>
    <p>
      INSTINCT sleeps, in order to a loftier waking; and
    </p>
    <p>
      IDEALISM learns, as its ultimate lesson, that self-sacrifice is true
      redemption; that the region beyond the grave is the fitting one for
      exemption from mortal conditions; and that Death is the everlasting
      portal, indicated by the finger of God,&mdash;the broad avenue through
      which man does not issue solitary and stealthy into the region of Free
      Existence, but enters triumphant, hailed by a hierarchy of immortal
      natures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result is (in other words), THAT THE UNIVERSAL HUMAN LOT IS, AFTER
      ALL, THAT OF THE HIGHEST PRIVILEGE.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
